abstract: This paper introduces a new general framework for forest-type regression
  which allows the development of robust forest regressors by selecting from a large
  family of robust loss functions. In particular, when plugged in the squared error
  and quantile losses, it will recover the classical random forest and quantile random
  forest. We then use robust loss functions to develop more robust forest-type regression
  algorithms. In the experiments, we show by simulation and real data that our robust
  forests are indeed much more insensitive to outliers, and choosing the right number
  of nearest neighbors can quickly improve the generalization performance of random
  forest.
