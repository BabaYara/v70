abstract: 'Latent space models (LSMs) provide a principled and effective way to extract
  hidden patterns from observed data. To cope with two challenges in LSMs: (1) how
  to capture infrequent patterns when pattern frequency is imbalanced and (2) how
  to reduce model size without sacrificing their expressiveness, several studies have
  been proposed to “diversify” LSMs, which design regularizers to encourage the components
  therein to be “diverse”. In light of the limitations of existing approaches, we
  design a new diversity-promoting regularizer by considering two factors: uncorrelation
  and evenness, which encourage the components to be uncorrelated and to play equally
  important roles in modeling data. Formally, this amounts to encouraging the covariance
  matrix of the components to have more uniform eigenvalues. We apply the regularizer
  to two LSMs and develop an efficient optimization algorithm. Experiments on healthcare,
  image and text data demonstrate the effectiveness of the regularizer.'
