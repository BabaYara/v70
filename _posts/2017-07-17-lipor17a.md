abstract: Many clustering problems in computer vision and other contexts are also
  classification problems, where each cluster shares a meaningful label. Subspace
  clustering algorithms in particular are often applied to problems that fit this
  description, for example with face images or handwritten digits. While it is straightforward
  to request human input on these datasets, our goal is to reduce this input as much
  as possible. We present a pairwise-constrained clustering algorithm that actively
  selects queries based on the union-of-subspaces model. The central step of the algorithm
  is in querying points of minimum margin between estimated subspaces; analogous to
  classifier margin, these lie near the decision boundary. We prove that points lying
  near the intersection of subspaces are points with low margin. Our procedure can
  be used after any subspace clustering algorithm that outputs an affinity matrix.
  We demonstrate on several datasets that our algorithm drives the clustering error
  down considerably faster than the state-of-the-art active query algorithms on datasets
  with subspace structure and is competitive on other datasets.
