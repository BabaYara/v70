abstract: A common practice in statistics and machine learning is to assume that the
  statistical data types (e.g., ordinal, categorical or real-valued) of variables,
  and usually also the likelihood model, is known. However, as the availability of
  real-world data increases, this assumption becomes too restrictive. Data are often
  heterogeneous, complex, and improperly or incompletely documented. Surprisingly,
  despite their practical importance, there is still a lack of tools to automatically
  discover the statistical types of, as well as appropriate likelihood (noise) models
  for, the variables in a dataset. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing a
  Bayesian method, which accurately discovers the statistical data types in both synthetic
  and real data.
