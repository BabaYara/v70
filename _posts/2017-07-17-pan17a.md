abstract: Sparse Spectrum Gaussian Processes (SSGPs) are a powerful tool for scaling
  Gaussian processes (GPs) to large datasets. Existing SSGP algorithms for regression
  assume deterministic inputs, precluding their use in many real-world robotics and
  engineering applications where accounting for input uncertainty is crucial. We address
  this problem by proposing two analytic moment-based approaches with closed-form
  expressions for SSGP regression with uncertain inputs. Our methods are more general
  and scalable than their standard GP counterparts, and are naturally applicable to
  multi-step prediction or uncertainty propagation. We show that efficient algorithms
  for Bayesian filtering and stochastic model predictive control can use these methods,
  and we evaluate our algorithms with comparative analyses and both real-world and
  simulated experiments.
