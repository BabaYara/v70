abstract: The standard Kernel Quadrature method for numerical integration with random
  point sets (also called Bayesian Monte Carlo) is known to converge in root mean
  square error at a rate determined by the ratio s/d, where s and d encode the smoothness
  and dimension of the integrand. However, an empirical investigation reveals that
  the rate constant C is highly sensitive to the distribution of the random points.
  In contrast to standard Monte Carlo integration, for which optimal importance sampling
  is well-understood, the sampling distribution that minimises C for Kernel Quadrature
  does not admit a closed form. This paper argues that the practical choice of sampling
  distribution is an important open problem. One solution is considered; a novel automatic
  approach based on adaptive tempering and sequential Monte Carlo. Empirical results
  demonstrate a dramatic reduction in integration error of up to 4 orders of magnitude
  can be achieved with the proposed method.
