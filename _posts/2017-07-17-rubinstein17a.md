abstract: Popular approaches to differential privacy, such as the Laplace and exponential
  mechanisms, calibrate randomised smoothing through global sensitivity of the target
  non-private function. Bounding such sensitivity is often a prohibitively complex
  analytic calculation. As an alternative, we propose a straightforward sampler for
  estimating sensitivity of non-private mechanisms. Since our sensitivity estimates
  hold with high probability, any mechanism that would be $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differentially
  private under bounded global sensitivity automatically achieves $(\epsilon,\delta,\gamma)$-random
  differential privacy (Hall et al. 2012), without any target-specific calculations
  required. We demonstrate on worked example learners how our usable approach adopts
  a naturally-relaxed privacy guarantee, while achieving more accurate releases even
  for non-private functions that are black-box computer programs.
