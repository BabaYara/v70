abstract: Despite their overwhelming capacity to overfit, deep learning architectures
  tend to generalize relatively well to unseen data, allowing them to be deployed
  in practice. However, explaining why this is the case is still an open area of research.
  One standing hypothesis that is gaining popularity, e.g.\ Hochreiter \& Schmidhuber
  (1997); Keskar et al.\ (2017), is that the flatness of minima of the loss function
  found by stochastic gradient based methods results in good generalization. This
  paper argues that most notions of flatness are problematic for deep models and can
  not be directly applied to explain generalization. Specifically, when focusing on
  deep networks with rectifier units, we can exploit the particular geometry of parameter
  space induced by the inherent symmetries that these architectures exhibit to build
  equivalent models corresponding to arbitrarily sharper minima. Or, depending on
  the definition of flatness, it is the same for any given minimum. Furthermore, if
  we allow to reparametrize a function, the geometry of its parameters can change
  drastically without affecting its generalization properties.
