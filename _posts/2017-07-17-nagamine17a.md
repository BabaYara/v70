abstract: Despite the recent success of deep learning, the nature of the transformations
  they apply to the input features remains poorly understood. This study provides
  an empirical framework to study the encoding properties of node activations in various
  layers of the network, and to construct the exact function applied to each data
  point in the form of a linear transform. These methods are used to discern and quantify
  properties of feed-forward neural networks trained to map acoustic features to phoneme
  labels. We show a selective and nonlinear warping of the feature space, achieved
  by forming prototypical functions to account for the possible variation of each
  class. This study provides a joint framework where the properties of node activations
  and the functions implemented by the network can be linked together.
