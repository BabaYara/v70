abstract: The problem of finding overlapping communities in networks has gained much
  attention recently. Optimization-based approaches use non-negative matrix factorization
  (NMF) or variants, but the global optimum cannot be provably attained in general.
  Model-based approaches, such as the popular mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel
  or MMSB (Airoldi et al., 2008), use parameters for each node to specify the overlapping
  communities, but standard inference techniques cannot guarantee consistency. We
  link the two approaches, by (a) establishing sufficient conditions for the symmetric
  NMF optimization to have a unique solution under MMSB, and (b) proposing a computationally
  efficient algorithm called GeoNMF that is provably optimal and hence consistent
  for a broad parameter regime. We demonstrate its accuracy on both simulated and
  real-world datasets.
