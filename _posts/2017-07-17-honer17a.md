abstract: Sybil detection is a crucial task to protect online social networks (OSNs)
  against intruders who try to manipulate automatic services provided by OSNs to their
  customers. In this paper, we first discuss the robustness of graph-based Sybil detectors
  SybilRank and Integro and refine theoretically their security guarantees towards
  more realistic assumptions. After that, we formally introduce adversarial settings
  for the graph-based Sybil detection problem and derive a corresponding optimal attacking
  strategy by exploitation of trust leaks. Based on our analysis, we propose transductive
  Sybil ranking (TSR), a robust extension to SybilRank and Integro that directly minimizes
  trust leaks. Our empirical evaluation shows significant advantages of TSR over state-of-the-art
  competitors on a variety of attacking scenarios on artificially generated data and
  real-world datasets.
