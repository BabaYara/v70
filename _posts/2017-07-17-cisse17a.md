abstract: We introduce Parseval networks, a form of deep neural networks in which
  the Lipschitz constant of linear, convolutional and aggregation layers is constrained
  to be smaller than $1$. Parseval networks are empirically and theoretically motivated
  by an analysis of the robustness of the predictions made by deep neural networks
  when their input is subject to an adversarial perturbation. The most important feature
  of Parseval networks is to maintain weight matrices of linear and convolutional
  layers to be (approximately) Parseval tight frames, which are extensions of orthogonal
  matrices to non-square matrices. We describe how these constraints can be maintained
  efficiently during SGD. We show that Parseval networks match the state-of-the-art
  regarding accuracy on CIFAR-10/100 and Street View House Numbers (SVHN), while being
  more robust than their vanilla counterpart against adversarial examples. Incidentally,
  Parseval networks also tend to train faster and make a better usage of the full
  capacity of the networks.
