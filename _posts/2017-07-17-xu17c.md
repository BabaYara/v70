abstract: The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is commonly used
  for distributed model fitting problems, but its performance and reliability depend
  strongly on user-defined penalty parameters. We study distributed ADMM methods that
  boost performance by using different fine-tuned algorithm parameters on each worker
  node. We present a O(1/k) convergence rate for adaptive ADMM methods with node-specific
  parameters, and propose adaptive consensus ADMM (ACADMM), which automatically tunes
  parameters without user oversight.
