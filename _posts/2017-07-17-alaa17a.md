abstract: 'Critically ill patients in regular wards are vulnerable to unanticipated
  adverse events which require prompt transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU). To
  allow for accurate prognosis of deteriorating patients, we develop a novel continuous-time
  probabilistic model for a monitored patient’s temporal sequence of physiological
  data. Our model captures “informatively sampled” patient episodes: the clinicians’
  decisions on when to observe a hospitalized patient’s vital signs and lab tests
  over time are represented by a marked Hawkes process, with intensity parameters
  that are modulated by the patient’s latent clinical states, and with observable
  physiological data (mark process) modeled as a switching multi-task Gaussian process.
  In addition, our model captures “informatively censored” patient episodes by representing
  the patient’s latent clinical states as an absorbing semi-Markov jump process. The
  model parameters are learned from offline patient episodes in the electronic health
  records via an EM-based algorithm. Experiments conducted on a cohort of patients
  admitted to a major medical center over a 3-year period show that risk prognosis
  based on our model significantly outperforms the currently deployed medical risk
  scores and other baseline machine learning algorithms.'
