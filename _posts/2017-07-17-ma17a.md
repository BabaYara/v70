abstract: 'Stochastic gradient MCMC (SG-MCMC) algorithms have proven useful in scaling
  Bayesian inference to large datasets under an assumption of i.i.d data. We instead
  develop an SG-MCMC algorithm to learn the parameters of hidden Markov models (HMMs)
  for time-dependent data. There are two challenges to applying SG-MCMC in this setting:
  The latent discrete states, and needing to break dependencies when considering minibatches.
  We consider a marginal likelihood representation of the HMM and propose an algorithm
  that harnesses the inherent memory decay of the process. We demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our algorithm on synthetic experiments and an ion channel recording data, with
  runtimes significantly outperforming batch MCMC.'
