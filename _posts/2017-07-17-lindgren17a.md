abstract: Given a graphical model, one essential problem is MAP inference, that is,
  finding the most likely configuration of states according to the model. Although
  this problem is NP-hard, large instances can be solved in practice and it is a major
  open question is to explain why this is true. We give a natural condition under
  which we can provably perform MAP inference in polynomial timeâ€”we require that the
  number of fractional vertices in the LP relaxation exceeding the optimal solution
  is bounded by a polynomial in the problem size. This resolves an open question by
  Dimakis, Gohari, and Wainwright. In contrast, for general LP relaxations of integer
  programs, known techniques can only handle a constant number of fractional vertices
  whose value exceeds the optimal solution. We experimentally verify this condition
  and demonstrate how efficient various integer programming methods are at removing
  fractional solutions.
