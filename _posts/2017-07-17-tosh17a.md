abstract: To date, the tightest upper and lower-bounds for the active learning of
  general concept classes have been in terms of a parameter of the learning problem
  called the splitting index. We provide, for the first time, an efficient algorithm
  that is able to realize this upper bound, and we empirically demonstrate its good
  performance.
