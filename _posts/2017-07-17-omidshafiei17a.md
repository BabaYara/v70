abstract: 'Many real-world tasks involve multiple agents with partial observability
  and limited communication. Learning is challenging in these settings due to local
  viewpoints of agents, which perceive the world as non-stationary due to concurrently-exploring
  teammates. Approaches that learn specialized policies for individual tasks face
  problems when applied to the real world: not only do agents have to learn and store
  distinct policies for each task, but in practice identities of tasks are often non-observable,
  making these approaches inapplicable. This paper formalizes and addresses the problem
  of multi-task multi-agent reinforcement learning under partial observability. We
  introduce a decentralized single-task learning approach that is robust to concurrent
  interactions of teammates, and present an approach for distilling single-task policies
  into a unified policy that performs well across multiple related tasks, without
  explicit provision of task identity.'
