abstract: 'We propose a new statistical dictionary learning algorithm for sparse signals
  that is based on an $α$-stable innovation model. The parameters of the underlying
  model—that is, the atoms of the dictionary, the sparsity index $α$ and the dispersion
  of the transform-domain coefficients—are recovered using a new type of probability
  distribution tomography. Specifically, we drive our estimator with a series of random
  projections of the data, which results in an efficient algorithm. Moreover, since
  the projections are achieved using linear combinations, we can invoke the generalized
  central limit theorem to justify the use of our method for sparse signals that are
  not necessarily $α$-stable. We evaluate our algorithm by performing two types of
  experiments: image in-painting and image denoising. In both cases, we find that
  our approach is competitive with state-of-the-art dictionary learning techniques.
  Beyond the algorithm itself, two aspects of this study are interesting in their
  own right. The first is our statistical formulation of the problem, which unifies
  the topics of dictionary learning and independent component analysis. The second
  is a generalization of a classical theorem about isometries of $\ell_p$-norms that
  constitutes the foundation of our approach.'
