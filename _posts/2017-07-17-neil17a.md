abstract: Many neural networks exhibit stability in their activation patterns over
  time in response to inputs from sensors operating under real-world conditions. By
  capitalizing on this property of natural signals, we propose a Recurrent Neural
  Network (RNN) architecture called a delta network in which each neuron transmits
  its value only when the change in its activation exceeds a threshold. The execution
  of RNNs as delta networks is attractive because their states must be stored and
  fetched at every timestep, unlike in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We show
  that a naive run-time delta network implementation offers modest improvements on
  the number of memory accesses and computes, but optimized training techniques confer
  higher accuracy at higher speedup. With these optimizations, we demonstrate a 9X
  reduction in cost with negligible loss of accuracy for the TIDIGITS audio digit
  recognition benchmark. Similarly, on the large Wall Street Journal (WSJ) speech
  recognition benchmark, pretrained networks can also be greatly accelerated as delta
  networks and trained delta networks show a 5.7x improvement with negligible loss
  of accuracy. Finally, on an end-to-end CNN-RNN network trained for steering angle
  prediction in a driving dataset, the RNN cost can be reduced by a substantial 100X.
