abstract: We investigate, theoretically and empirically, the effectiveness of kernel
  K-means++ samples as landmarks in the Nyström method for low-rank approximation
  of kernel matrices. Previous empirical studies (Zhang et al., 2008; Kumar et al.,2012)
  observe that the landmarks obtained using (kernel) K-means clustering define a good
  low-rank approximation of kernel matrices. However, the existing work does not provide
  a theoretical guarantee on the approximation error for this approach to landmark
  selection. We close this gap and provide the first bound on the approximation error
  of the Nyström method with kernel K-means++ samples as landmarks. Moreover, for
  the frequently used Gaussian kernel we provide a theoretically sound motivation
  for performing Lloyd refinements of kernel K-means++ landmarks in the instance space.
  We substantiate our theoretical results empirically by comparing the approach to
  several state-of-the-art algorithms.
