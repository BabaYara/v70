abstract: We introduce new families of Integral Probability Metrics (IPM) for training
  Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Our IPMs are based on matching statistics
  of distributions embedded in a finite dimensional feature space. Mean and covariance
  feature matching IPMs allow for stable training of GANs, which we will call McGan.
  McGan minimizes a meaningful loss between distributions.
