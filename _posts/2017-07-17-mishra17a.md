abstract: We introduce a method for learning the dynamics of complex nonlinear systems
  based on deep generative models over temporal segments of states and actions. Unlike
  dynamics models that operate over individual discrete timesteps, we learn the distribution
  over future state trajectories conditioned on past state, past action, and planned
  future action trajectories, as well as a latent prior over action trajectories.
  Our approach is based on convolutional autoregressive models and variational autoencoders.
  It makes stable and accurate predictions over long horizons for complex, stochastic
  systems, effectively expressing uncertainty and modeling the effects of collisions,
  sensory noise, and action delays. The learned dynamics model and action prior can
  be used for end-to-end, fully differentiable trajectory optimization and model-based
  policy optimization, which we use to evaluate the performance and sample-efficiency
  of our method.
