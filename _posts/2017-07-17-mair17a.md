abstract: Archetypal Analysis is the method of choice to compute interpretable matrix
  factorizations. Every data point is represented as a convex combination of factors,
  i.e., points on the boundary of the convex hull of the data. This renders computation
  inefficient. In this paper, we show that the set of vertices of a convex hull, the
  so-called frame, can be efficiently computed by a quadratic program. We provide
  theoretical and empirical results for our proposed approach and make use of the
  frame to accelerate Archetypal Analysis. The novel method yields similar reconstruction
  errors as baseline competitors but is much faster to compute.
