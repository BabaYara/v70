abstract: This paper presents the input convex neural network architecture. These
  are scalar-valued (potentially deep) neural networks with constraints on the network
  parameters such that the output of the network is a convex function of (some of)
  the inputs. The networks allow for efficient inference via optimization over some
  inputs to the network given others, and can be applied to settings including structured
  prediction, data imputation, reinforcement learning, and others. In this paper we
  lay the basic groundwork for these models, proposing methods for inference, optimization
  and learning, and analyze their representational power. We show that many existing
  neural network architectures can be made input-convex with a minor modification,
  and develop specialized optimization algorithms tailored to this setting. Finally,
  we highlight the performance of the methods on multi-label prediction, image completion,
  and reinforcement learning problems, where we show improvement over the existing
  state of the art in many cases.
