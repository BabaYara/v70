abstract: Understanding how users navigate in a network is of high interest in many
  applications. We consider a setting where only aggregate node-level traffic is observed
  and tackle the task of learning edge transition probabilities. We cast it as a preference
  learning problem, and we study a model where choices follow Luce’s axiom. In this
  case, the $O(n)$ marginal counts of node visits are a sufficient statistic for the
  $O(n^2)$ transition probabilities. We show how to make the inference problem well-posed
  regardless of the network’s structure, and we present ChoiceRank, an iterative algorithm
  that scales to networks that contains billions of nodes and edges. We apply the
  model to two clickstream datasets and show that it successfully recovers the transition
  probabilities using only the network structure and marginal (node-level) traffic
  data. Finally, we also consider an application to mobility networks and apply the
  model to one year of rides on New York City’s bicycle-sharing system.
