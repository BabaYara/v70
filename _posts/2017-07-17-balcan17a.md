abstract: We study the problem of clustering sensitive data while preserving the privacy
  of individuals represented in the dataset, which has broad applications in practical
  machine learning and data analysis tasks. Although the problem has been widely studied
  in the context of low-dimensional, discrete spaces, much remains unknown concerning
  private clustering in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces $\mathbbR^d$. In this work,
  we give differentially private and efficient algorithms achieving strong guarantees
  for $k$-means and $k$-median clustering when $d=Î©(\mathsfpolylog(n))$. Our algorithm
  achieves clustering loss at most $\log^3(n)\mathsfOPT+\mathsfpoly(\log n,d,k)$,
  advancing the state-of-the-art result of $\sqrtd\mathsfOPT+\mathsfpoly(\log n,d^d,k^d)$.
  We also study the case where the data points are $s$-sparse and show that the clustering
  loss can scale logarithmically with $d$, i.e., $\log^3(n)\mathsfOPT+\mathsfpoly(\log
  n,\log d,k,s)$. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets verify the effectiveness
  of the proposed method.
