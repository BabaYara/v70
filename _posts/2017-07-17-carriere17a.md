abstract: Persistence diagrams (PDs) play a key role in topological data analysis
  (TDA), in which they are routinely used to describe succinctly complex topological
  properties of complicated shapes. PDs enjoy strong stability properties and have
  proven their utility in various learning contexts. They do not, however, live in
  a space naturally endowed with a Hilbert structure and are usually compared with
  specific distances, such as the bottleneck distance. To incorporate PDs in a learning
  pipeline, several kernels have been proposed for PDs with a strong emphasis on the
  stability of the RKHS distance w.r.t. perturbations of the PDs. In this article,
  we use the Sliced Wasserstein approximation of the Wasserstein distance to define
  a new kernel for PDs, which is not only provably stable but also provably discriminative
  w.r.t. the Wasserstein distance $W^1_\infty$ between PDs. We also demonstrate its
  practicality, by developing an approximation technique to reduce kernel computation
  time, and show that our proposal compares favorably to existing kernels for PDs
  on several benchmarks.
