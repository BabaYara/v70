abstract: This paper introduces DeepBach, a graphical model aimed at modeling polyphonic
  music and specifically hymn-like pieces. We claim that, after being trained on the
  chorale harmonizations by Johann Sebastian Bach, our model is capable of generating
  highly convincing chorales in the style of Bach. DeepBach’s strength comes from
  the use of pseudo-Gibbs sampling coupled with an adapted representation of musical
  data. This is in contrast with many automatic music composition approaches which
  tend to compose music sequentially. Our model is also steerable in the sense that
  a user can constrain the generation by imposing positional constraints such as notes,
  rhythms or cadences in the generated score. We also provide a plugin on top of the
  MuseScore music editor making the interaction with DeepBach easy to use.
