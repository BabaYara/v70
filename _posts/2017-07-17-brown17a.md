abstract: Iterative algorithms such as Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) are
  the most popular way to solve large zero-sum imperfect-information games. In this
  paper we introduce Best-Response Pruning (BRP), an improvement to iterative algorithms
  such as CFR that allows poorly-performing actions to be temporarily pruned. We prove
  that when using CFR in zero-sum games, adding BRP will asymptotically prune any
  action that is not part of a best response to some Nash equilibrium. This leads
  to provably faster convergence and lower space requirements. Experiments show that
  BRP results in a factor of 7 reduction in space, and the reduction factor increases
  with game size.
