abstract: We present a neural encoder-decoder model to convert images into presentational
  markup based on a scalable coarse-to-fine attention mechanism. Our method is evaluated
  in the context of image-to-LaTeX generation, and we introduce a new dataset of real-world
  rendered mathematical expressions paired with LaTeX markup. We show that unlike
  neural OCR techniques using CTC-based models, attention-based approaches can tackle
  this non-standard OCR task. Our approach outperforms classical mathematical OCR
  systems by a large margin on in-domain rendered data, and, with pretraining, also
  performs well on out-of-domain handwritten data. To reduce the inference complexity
  associated with the attention-based approaches, we introduce a new coarse-to-fine
  attention layer that selects a support region before applying attention.
