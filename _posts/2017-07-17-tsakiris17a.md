abstract: State-of-the-art methods for clustering data drawn from a union of subspaces
  are based on sparse and low-rank representation theory and convex optimization algorithms.
  Existing results guaranteeing the correctness of such methods require the dimension
  of the subspaces to be small relative to the dimension of the ambient space. When
  this assumption is violated, as is, e.g., in the case of hyperplanes, existing methods
  are either computationally too intensive (e.g., algebraic methods) or lack sufficient
  theoretical support (e.g., K-Hyperplanes or RANSAC). In this paper we provide theoretical
  and algorithmic contributions to the problem of clustering data from a union of
  hyperplanes, by extending a recent subspace learning method called Dual Principal
  Component Pursuit (DPCP) to the multi-hyperplane case. We give theoretical guarantees
  under which, the non-convex $\ell_1$ problem associated with DPCP admits a unique
  global minimizer equal to the normal vector of the most dominant hyperplane. Inspired
  by this insight, we propose sequential (RANSAC-style) and iterative (K-Hyperplanes-style)
  hyperplane learning DPCP algorithms, which, via experiments on synthetic and real
  data, are shown to outperform or be competitive to the state-of-the-art.
