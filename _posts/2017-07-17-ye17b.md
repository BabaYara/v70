abstract: Learning under a Wasserstein loss, a.k.a. Wasserstein loss minimization
  (WLM), is an emerging research topic for gaining insights from a large set of structured
  objects. Despite being conceptually simple, WLM problems are computationally challenging
  because they involve minimizing over functions of quantities (i.e. Wasserstein distances)
  that themselves require numerical algorithms to compute. In this paper, we introduce
  a stochastic approach based on simulated annealing for solving WLMs. Particularly,
  we have developed a Gibbs sampler to approximate effectively and efficiently the
  partial gradients of a sequence of Wasserstein losses. Our new approach has the
  advantages of numerical stability and readiness for warm starts. These characteristics
  are valuable for WLM problems that often require multiple levels of iterations in
  which the oracle for computing the value and gradient of a loss function is embedded.
  We applied the method to optimal transport with Coulomb cost and the Wasserstein
  non-negative matrix factorization problem, and made comparisons with the existing
  method of entropy regularization.
