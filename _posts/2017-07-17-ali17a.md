abstract: We introduce Newton-ADMM, a method for fast conic optimization. The basic
  idea is to view the residuals of consecutive iterates generated by the alternating
  direction method of multipliers (ADMM) as a set of fixed point equations, and then
  use a nonsmooth Newton method to find a solution; we apply the basic idea to the
  Splitting Cone Solver (SCS), a state-of-the-art method for solving generic conic
  optimization problems. We demonstrate theoretically, by extending the theory of
  semismooth operators, that Newton-ADMM converges rapidly (i.e., quadratically) to
  a solution; empirically, Newton-ADMM is significantly faster than SCS on a number
  of problems. The method also has essentially no tuning parameters, generates certificates
  of primal or dual infeasibility, when appropriate, and can be specialized to solve
  specific convex problems.
