abstract: We solve tensor balancing, rescaling an Nth order nonnegative tensor by
  multiplying N tensors of order N - 1 so that every fiber sums to one. This generalizes
  a fundamental process of matrix balancing used to compare matrices in a wide range
  of applications from biology to economics. We present an efficient balancing algorithm
  with quadratic convergence using Newton’s method and show in numerical experiments
  that the proposed algorithm is several orders of magnitude faster than existing
  ones. To theoretically prove the correctness of the algorithm, we model tensors
  as probability distributions in a statistical manifold and realize tensor balancing
  as projection onto a submanifold. The key to our algorithm is that the gradient
  of the manifold, used as a Jacobian matrix in Newton’s method, can be analytically
  obtained using the Möbius inversion formula, the essential of combinatorial mathematics.
  Our model is not limited to tensor balancing, but has a wide applicability as it
  includes various statistical and machine learning models such as weighted DAGs and
  Boltzmann machines.
