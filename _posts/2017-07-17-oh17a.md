abstract: 'As a step towards developing zero-shot task generalization capabilities
  in reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce a new RL problem where the agent should
  learn to execute sequences of instructions after learning useful skills that solve
  subtasks. In this problem, we consider two types of generalizations: to previously
  unseen instructions and to longer sequences of instructions. For generalization
  over unseen instructions, we propose a new objective which encourages learning correspondences
  between similar subtasks by making analogies. For generalization over sequential
  instructions, we present a hierarchical architecture where a meta controller learns
  to use the acquired skills for executing the instructions. To deal with delayed
  reward, we propose a new neural architecture in the meta controller that learns
  when to update the subtask, which makes learning more efficient. Experimental results
  on a stochastic 3D domain show that the proposed ideas are crucial for generalization
  to longer instructions as well as unseen instructions.'
