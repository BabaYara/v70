abstract: This paper proposes a general method for improving the structure and quality
  of sequences generated by a recurrent neural network (RNN), while maintaining information
  originally learned from data, as well as sample diversity. An RNN is first pre-trained
  on data using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), and the probability distribution
  over the next token in the sequence learned by this model is treated as a prior
  policy. Another RNN is then trained using reinforcement learning (RL) to generate
  higher-quality outputs that account for domain-specific incentives while retaining
  proximity to the prior policy of the MLE RNN. To formalize this objective, we derive
  novel off-policy RL methods for RNNs from KL-control. The effectiveness of the approach
  is demonstrated on two applications; 1) generating novel musical melodies, and 2)
  computational molecular generation. For both problems, we show that the proposed
  method improves the desired properties and structure of the generated sequences,
  while maintaining information learned from data.
