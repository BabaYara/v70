abstract: It is shown that training of generative adversarial network (GAN) may not
  have good generalization properties; e.g., training may appear successful but the
  trained distribution may be far from target distribution in standard metrics. However,
  generalization does occur for a weaker metric called neural net distance. It is
  also shown that an approximate pure equilibrium exists in the discriminator/generator
  game for a natural training objective (Wasserstein) when generator capacity and
  training set sizes are moderate. This existence of equilibrium inspires MIX+GAN
  protocol, which can be combined with any existing GAN training, and empirically
  shown to improve some of them.
