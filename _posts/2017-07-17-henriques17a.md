abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are extremely efficient, since they
  exploit the inherent translation-invariance of natural images. However, translation
  is just one of a myriad of useful spatial transformations. Can the same efficiency
  be attained when considering other spatial invariances? Such generalized convolutions
  have been considered in the past, but at a high computational cost. We present a
  construction that is simple and exact, yet has the same computational complexity
  that standard convolutions enjoy. It consists of a constant image warp followed
  by a simple convolution, which are standard blocks in deep learning toolboxes. With
  a carefully crafted warp, the resulting architecture can be made equivariant to
  a wide range of two-parameter spatial transformations. We show encouraging results
  in realistic scenarios, including the estimation of vehicle poses in the Google
  Earth dataset (rotation and scale), and face poses in Annotated Facial Landmarks
  in the Wild (3D rotations under perspective).
