abstract: Bandit methods for black-box optimisation, such as Bayesian optimisation,
  are used in a variety of applications including hyper-parameter tuning and experiment
  design. Recently, \emphmulti-fidelity methods have garnered considerable attention
  since function evaluations have become increasingly expensive in such applications.
  Multi-fidelity methods use cheap approximations to the function of interest to speed
  up the overall optimisation process. However, most multi-fidelity methods assume
  only a finite number of approximations. On the other hand, in many practical applications,
  a continuous spectrum of approximations might be available. For instance, when tuning
  an expensive neural network, one might choose to approximate the cross validation
  performance using less data $N$ and/or few training iterations $T$. Here, the approximations
  are best viewed as arising out of a continuous two dimensional space $(N,T)$. In
  this work, we develop a Bayesian optimisation method, BOCA, for this setting. We
  characterise its theoretical properties and show that it achieves better regret
  than than strategies which ignore the approximations. BOCA outperforms several other
  baselines in synthetic and real experiments.
