abstract: The Recurrent Neural Networks and their variants have shown promising performances
  in sequence modeling tasks such as Natural Language Processing. These models, however,
  turn out to be impractical and difficult to train when exposed to very high-dimensional
  inputs due to the large input-to-hidden weight matrix. This may have prevented RNNsâ€™
  large-scale application in tasks that involve very high input dimensions such as
  video modeling; current approaches reduce the input dimensions using various feature
  extractors. To address this challenge, we propose a new, more general and efficient
  approach by factorizing the input-to-hidden weight matrix using Tensor-Train decomposition
  which is trained simultaneously with the weights themselves. We test our model on
  classification tasks using multiple real-world video datasets and achieve competitive
  performances with state-of-the-art models, even though our model architecture is
  orders of magnitude less complex. We believe that the proposed approach provides
  a novel and fundamental building block for modeling high-dimensional sequential
  data with RNN architectures and opens up many possibilities to transfer the expressive
  and advanced architectures from other domains such as NLP to modeling high-dimensional
  sequential data.
