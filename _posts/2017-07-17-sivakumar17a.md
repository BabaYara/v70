abstract: Quantile regression aims at modeling the conditional median and quantiles
  of a response variable given certain predictor variables. In this work we consider
  the problem of linear quantile regression in high dimensions where the number of
  predictor variables is much higher than the number of samples available for parameter
  estimation. We assume the true parameter to have some structure characterized as
  having a small value according to some atomic norm R(.) and consider the norm regularized
  quantile regression estimator. We characterize the sample complexity for consistent
  recovery and give non-asymptotic bounds on the estimation error. While this problem
  has been previously considered, our analysis reveals geometric and statistical characteristics
  of the problem not available in prior literature. We perform experiments on synthetic
  data which support the theoretical results.
