abstract: Contextual bandits are widely used in Internet services from news recommendation
  to advertising, and to Web search. Generalized linear models (logistical regression
  in particular) have demonstrated stronger performance than linear models in many
  applications where rewards are binary. However, most theoretical analyses on contextual
  bandits so far are on linear bandits. In this work, we propose an upper confidence
  bound based algorithm for generalized linear contextual bandits, which achieves
  an $\sim O(\sqrt{dT})$ regret over T rounds with d dimensional feature vectors.
  This regret matches the minimax lower bound, up to logarithmic terms, and improves
  on the best previous result by a $\sqrt{d}$ factor, assuming the number of arms
  is fixed. A key component in our analysis is to establish a new, sharp finite-sample
  confidence bound for maximum likelihood estimates in generalized linear models,
  which may be of independent interest. We also analyze a simpler upper confidence
  bound algorithm, which is useful in practice, and prove it to have optimal regret
  for certain cases.
