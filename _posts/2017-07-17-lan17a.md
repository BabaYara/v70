abstract: In this work we introduce a conditional accelerated lazy stochastic gradient
  descent algorithm with optimal number of calls to a stochastic first-order oracle
  and convergence rate $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ improving over the projection-free, Online
  Frank-Wolfe based stochastic gradient descent of (Hazan and Kale, 2012) with convergence
  rate $O(1/\epsilon^4)$.
