abstract: A long-standing obstacle to progress in deep learning is the problem of
  vanishing and exploding gradients. Although, the problem has largely been overcome
  via carefully constructed initializations and batch normalization, architectures
  incorporating skip-connections such as highway and resnets perform much better than
  standard feedforward architectures despite well-chosen initialization and batch
  normalization. In this paper, we identify the shattered gradients problem. Specifically,
  we show that the correlation between gradients in standard feedforward networks
  decays exponentially with depth resulting in gradients that resemble white noise
  whereas, in contrast, the gradients in architectures with skip-connections are far
  more resistant to shattering, decaying sublinearly. Detailed empirical evidence
  is presented in support of the analysis, on both fully-connected networks and convnets.
  Finally, we present a new “looks linear” (LL) initialization that prevents shattering,
  with preliminary experiments showing the new initialization allows to train very
  deep networks without the addition of skip-connections.
