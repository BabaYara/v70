abstract: 'Counterfactual prediction requires understanding causal relationships between
  so-called treatment and outcome variables. This paper provides a recipe for augmenting
  deep learning methods to accurately characterize such relationships in the presence
  of instrument variables (IVs) â€“ sources of treatment randomization that are conditionally
  independent from the outcomes. Our IV specification resolves into two prediction
  tasks that can be solved with deep neural nets: a first-stage network for treatment
  prediction and a second-stage network whose loss function involves integration over
  the conditional treatment distribution. This Deep IV framework allows us to take
  advantage of off-the-shelf supervised learning techniques to estimate causal effects
  by adapting the loss function. Experiments show that it outperforms existing machine
  learning approaches.'
