abstract: Low-rank matrix approximation is a fundamental tool in data analysis for
  processing large datasets, reducing noise, and finding important signals. In this
  work, we present a novel truncated LU factorization called Spectrum-Revealing LU
  (SRLU) for effective low-rank matrix approximation, and develop a fast algorithm
  to compute an SRLU factorization. We provide both matrix and singular value approximation
  error bounds for the SRLU approximation computed by our algorithm. Our analysis
  suggests that SRLU is competitive with the best low-rank matrix approximation methods,
  deterministic or randomized, in both computational complexity and approximation
  quality. Numeric experiments illustrate that SRLU preserves sparsity, highlights
  important data features and variables, can be efficiently updated, and calculates
  data approximations nearly as accurately as the best possible. To the best of our
  knowledge this is the first practical variant of the LU factorization for effective
  and efficient low-rank matrix approximation.
