abstract: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is an efficient and effective means of sampling
  posterior distributions on Euclidean space, which has been extended to manifolds
  with boundary. However, some applications require an extension to more general spaces.
  For example, phylogenetic (evolutionary) trees are defined in terms of both a discrete
  graph and associated continuous parameters; although one can represent these aspects
  using a single connected space, this rather complex space is not suitable for existing
  HMC algorithms. In this paper, we develop Probabilistic Path HMC (PPHMC) as a first
  step to sampling distributions on spaces with intricate combinatorial structure.
  We define PPHMC on orthant complexes, show that the resulting Markov chain is ergodic,
  and provide a promising implementation for the case of phylogenetic trees in open-source
  software. We also show that a surrogate function to ease the transition across a
  boundary on which the log-posterior has discontinuous derivatives can greatly improve
  efficiency.
