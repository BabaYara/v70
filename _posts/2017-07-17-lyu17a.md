abstract: We propose Spherical Structured Feature (SSF) maps to approximate shift
  and rotation invariant kernels as well as $b^{th}$-order arc-cosine kernels (Cho
  \& Saul, 2009). We construct SSF maps based on the point set on $d-1$ dimensional
  sphere $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$. We prove that the inner product of SSF maps are unbiased
  estimates for above kernels if asymptotically uniformly distributed point set on
  $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ is given. According to (Brauchart \& Grabner, 2015), optimizing
  the discrete Riesz s-energy can generate asymptotically uniformly distributed point
  set on $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$. Thus, we propose an efficient coordinate decent method
  to find a local optimum of the discrete Riesz s-energy for SSF maps construction.
  Theoretically, SSF maps construction achieves linear space complexity and loglinear
  time complexity. Empirically, SSF maps achieve superior performance compared with
  other methods.
