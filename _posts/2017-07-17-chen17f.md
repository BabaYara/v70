abstract: We developed a novel approach to identification and model testing in linear
  structural equation models (SEMs) based on auxiliary variables (AVs), which generalizes
  a widely-used family of methods known as instrumental variables. The identification
  problem is concerned with the conditions under which causal parameters can be uniquely
  estimated from an observational, non-causal covariance matrix. In this paper, we
  provide an algorithm for the identification of causal parameters in linear structural
  models that subsumes previous state-of-the-art methods. In other words, our algorithm
  identifies strictly more coefficients and models than methods previously known in
  the literature. Our algorithm builds on a graph-theoretic characterization of conditional
  independence relations between auxiliary and model variables, which is developed
  in this paper. Further, we leverage this new characterization for allowing identification
  when limited experimental data or new substantive knowledge about the domain is
  available. Lastly, we develop a new procedure for model testing using AVs.
