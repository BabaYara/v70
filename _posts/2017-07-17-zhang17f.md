abstract: We describe the class of convexified convolutional neural networks (CCNNs),
  which capture the parameter sharing of convolutional neural networks in a convex
  manner. By representing the nonlinear convolutional filters as vectors in a reproducing
  kernel Hilbert space, the CNN parameters can be represented as a low-rank matrix,
  which can be relaxed to obtain a convex optimization problem. For learning two-layer
  convolutional neural networks, we prove that the generalization error obtained by
  a convexified CNN converges to that of the best possible CNN. For learning deeper
  networks, we train CCNNs in a layer-wise manner. Empirically, CCNNs achieve competitive
  or better performance than CNNs trained by backpropagation, SVMs, fully-connected
  neural networks, stacked denoising auto-encoders, and other baseline methods.
