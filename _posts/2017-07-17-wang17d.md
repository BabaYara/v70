abstract: We study the problem of estimating the high-dimensional Gaussian graphical
  model where the data are arbitrarily corrupted. We propose a robust estimator for
  the sparse precision matrix in the high-dimensional regime. At the core of our method
  is a robust covariance matrix estimator, which is based on truncated inner product.
  We establish the statistical guarantee of our estimator on both estimation error
  and model selection consistency. In particular, we show that provided that the number
  of corrupted samples $n_2$ for each variable satisfies $n_2 \lesssim \sqrt{n}/\sqrt{\log
  d}$, where $n$ is the sample size and $d$ is the number of variables, the proposed
  robust precision matrix estimator attains the same statistical rate as the standard
  estimator for Gaussian graphical models. In addition, we propose a hypothesis testing
  procedure to assess the uncertainty of our robust estimator. We demonstrate the
  effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic data
  and real-world genomic data.
