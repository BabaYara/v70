abstract: We solve principal component regression (PCR), up to a multiplicative accuracy
  $1+\gamma$, by reducing the problem to $\tilde{O}(\gamma^{-1})$ black-box calls
  of ridge regression. Therefore, our algorithm does not require any explicit construction
  of the top principal components, and is suitable for large-scale PCR instances.
  In contrast, previous result requires $\tilde{O}(\gamma^{-2})$ such black-box calls.
  We obtain this result by developing a general stable recurrence formula for matrix
  Chebyshev polynomials, and a degree-optimal polynomial approximation to the matrix
  sign function. Our techniques may be of independent interests, especially when designing
  iterative methods.
