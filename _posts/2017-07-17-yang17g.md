abstract: 'Imposing sparse + group-sparse superposition structures in high-dimensional
  parameter estimation is known to provide flexible regularization that is more realistic
  for many real-world problems. For example, such a superposition enables partially-shared
  support sets in multi-task learning, thereby striking the right balance between
  parameter overlap across tasks and task specificity. Existing theoretical results
  on estimation consistency, however, are problematic as they require too stringent
  an assumption: the incoherence between sparse and group-sparse superposed components.
  In this paper, we fill the gap between the practical success and suboptimal analysis
  of sparse + group-sparse models, by providing the first consistency results that
  do not require unrealistic assumptions. We also study non-convex counterparts of
  sparse + group-sparse models. Interestingly, we show that these are guaranteed to
  recover the true support set under much milder conditions and with smaller sample
  size than convex models, which might be critical in practical applications as illustrated
  by our experiments.'
