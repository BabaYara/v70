abstract: 'This paper develops a novel tree-based algorithm, called Bonsai, for efficient
  prediction on IoT devices – such as those based on the Arduino Uno board having
  an 8 bit ATmega328P microcontroller operating at 16 MHz with no native floating
  point support, 2 KB RAM and 32 KB read-only flash. Bonsai maintains prediction accuracy
  while minimizing model size and prediction costs by: (a) developing a tree model
  which learns a single, shallow, sparse tree with powerful nodes; (b) sparsely projecting
  all data into a low-dimensional space in which the tree is learnt; and (c) jointly
  learning all tree and projection parameters. Experimental results on multiple benchmark
  datasets demonstrate that Bonsai can make predictions in milliseconds even on slow
  microcontrollers, can fit in KB of memory, has lower battery consumption than all
  other algorithms while achieving prediction accuracies that can be as much as 30%
  higher than state-of-the-art methods for resource-efficient machine learning. Bonsai
  is also shown to generalize to other resource constrained settings beyond IoT by
  generating significantly better search results as compared to Bing’s L3 ranker when
  the model size is restricted to 300 bytes. Bonsai’s code can be downloaded from
