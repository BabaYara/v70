abstract: Learning to learn has emerged as an important direction for achieving artificial
  intelligence. Two of the primary barriers to its adoption are an inability to scale
  to larger problems and a limited ability to generalize to new tasks. We introduce
  a learned gradient descent optimizer that generalizes well to new tasks, and which
  has significantly reduced memory and computation overhead. We achieve this by introducing
  a novel hierarchical RNN architecture, with minimal per-parameter overhead, augmented
  with additional architectural features that mirror the known structure of optimization
  tasks. We also develop a meta-training ensemble of small, diverse, optimization
  tasks capturing common properties of loss landscapes. The optimizer learns to outperform
  RMSProp/ADAM on problems in this corpus. More importantly, it performs comparably
  or better when applied to small convolutional neural networks, despite seeing no
  neural networks in its meta-training set. Finally, it generalizes to train Inception
  V3 and ResNet V2 architectures on the ImageNet dataset for thousands of steps, optimization
  problems that are of a vastly different scale than those it was trained on.
