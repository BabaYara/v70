abstract: In this paper we analyze the robustness of stochastic variants of the greedy
  algorithm for submodular maximization. Our main result shows that for maximizing
  a monotone submodular function under a cardinality constraint, iteratively selecting
  an element whose marginal contribution is approximately maximal in expectation is
  a sufficient condition to obtain the optimal approximation guarantee with exponentially
  high probability, assuming the cardinality is sufficiently large. One consequence
  of our result is that the linear-time STOCHASTIC-GREEDY algorithm recently proposed
  in (Mirzasoleiman et al.,2015) achieves the optimal running time while maintaining
  an optimal approximation guarantee. We also show that high probability guarantees
  cannot be obtained for stochastic greedy algorithms under matroid constraints, and
  prove an approximation guarantee which holds in expectation. In contrast to the
  guarantees of the greedy algorithm, we show that the approximation ratio of stochastic
  local search is arbitrarily bad, with high probability, as well as in expectation.
