abstract: 'Deep neural networks coupled with fast simulation and improved computational
  speeds have led to recent successes in the field of reinforcement learning (RL).
  However, most current RL-based approaches fail to generalize since: (a) the gap
  between simulation and real world is so large that policy-learning approaches fail
  to transfer; (b) even if policy learning is done in real world, the data scarcity
  leads to failed generalization from training to test scenarios (e.g., due to different
  friction or object masses). Inspired from H-infinity control methods, we note that
  both modeling errors and differences in training and test scenarios can just be
  viewed as extra forces/disturbances in the system. This paper proposes the idea
  of robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL), where we train an agent to
  operate in the presence of a destabilizing adversary that applies disturbance forces
  to the system. The jointly trained adversary is reinforced â€“ that is, it learns
  an optimal destabilization policy. We formulate the policy learning as a zero-sum,
  minimax objective function. Extensive experiments in multiple environments (InvertedPendulum,
  HalfCheetah, Swimmer, Hopper, Walker2d and Ant) conclusively demonstrate that our
  method (a) improves training stability; (b) is robust to differences in training/test
  conditions; and c) outperform the baseline even in the absence of the adversary.'
