abstract: This paper presents a remarkably simple, yet powerful, algorithm for robust
  Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In the proposed approach, an outlier is set
  apart from an inlier by comparing their coherence with the rest of the data points.
  As inliers lie on a low dimensional subspace, they are likely to have strong mutual
  coherence provided there are enough inliers. By contrast, outliers do not typically
  admit low dimensional structures, wherefore an outlier is unlikely to bear strong
  resemblance with a large number of data points. The mutual coherences are computed
  by forming the Gram matrix of normalized data points. Subsequently, the subspace
  is recovered from the span of a small subset of the data points that exhibit strong
  coherence with the rest of the data. As coherence pursuit only involves one simple
  matrix multiplication, it is significantly faster than the state of-the-art robust
  PCA algorithms. We provide a mathematical analysis of the proposed algorithm under
  a random model for the distribution of the inliers and outliers. It is shown that
  the proposed method can recover the correct subspace even if the data is predominantly
  outliers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first provable robust PCA algorithm
  that is simultaneously non-iterative, can tolerate a large number of outliers and
  is robust to linearly dependent outliers.
