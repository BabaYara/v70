abstract: 'This paper is about the study of B-FQI, an Approximated Value Iteration
  (AVI) algorithm that exploits a boosting procedure to estimate the action-value
  function in reinforcement learning problems. B-FQI is an iterative off-line algorithm
  that, given a dataset of transitions, builds an approximation of the optimal action-value
  function by summing the approximations of the Bellman residuals across all iterations.
  The advantage of such approach w.r.t. to other AVI methods is twofold: (1) while
  keeping the same function space at each iteration, B-FQI can represent more complex
  functions by considering an additive model; (2) since the Bellman residual decreases
  as the optimal value function is approached, regression problems become easier as
  iterations proceed. We study B-FQI both theoretically, providing also a finite-sample
  error upper bound for it, and empirically, by comparing its performance to the one
  of FQI in different domains and using different regression techniques.'
