abstract: Finite-sum optimization problems are ubiquitous in machine learning, and
  are commonly solved using first-order methods which rely on gradient computations.
  Recently, there has been growing interest in <em>second-order</em> methods, which
  rely on both gradients and Hessians. In principle, second-order methods can require
  much fewer iterations than first-order methods, and hold the promise for more efficient
  algorithms. Although computing and manipulating Hessians is prohibitive for high-dimensional
  problems in general, the Hessians of individual functions in finite-sum problems
  can often be efficiently computed, e.g. because they possess a low-rank structure.
  Can second-order information indeed be used to solve such problems more efficiently?
  In this paper, we provide evidence that the answer – perhaps surprisingly – is negative,
  at least in terms of worst-case guarantees. However, we also discuss what additional
  assumptions and algorithmic approaches might potentially circumvent this negative
  result.
