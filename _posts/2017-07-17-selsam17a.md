abstract: Noisy data, non-convex objectives, model misspecification, and numerical
  instability can all cause undesired behaviors in machine learning systems. As a
  result, detecting actual implementation errors can be extremely difficult. We demonstrate
  a methodology in which developers use an interactive proof assistant to both implement
  their system and to state a formal theorem defining what it means for their system
  to be correct. The process of proving this theorem interactively in the proof assistant
  exposes all implementation errors since any error in the program would cause the
  proof to fail. As a case study, we implement a new system, Certigrad, for optimizing
  over stochastic computation graphs, and we generate a formal (i.e. machine-checkable)
  proof that the gradients sampled by the system are unbiased estimates of the true
  mathematical gradients. We train a variational autoencoder using Certigrad and find
  the performance comparable to training the same model in TensorFlow.
