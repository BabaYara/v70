abstract: We consider the problem of approximating a given matrix by a low-rank matrix
  so as to minimize the entrywise $\ell_p$-approximation error, for any $p \geq 1$;
  the case $p = 2$ is the classical SVD problem. We obtain the first provably good
  approximation algorithms for this robust version of low-rank approximation that
  work for every value of $p$. Our algorithms are simple, easy to implement, work
  well in practice, and illustrate interesting tradeoffs between the approximation
  quality, the running time, and the rank of the approximating matrix.
