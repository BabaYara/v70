abstract: The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has achieved great success in generating
  realistic (real-valued) synthetic data. However, convergence issues and difficulties
  dealing with discrete data hinder the applicability of GAN to text. We propose a
  framework for generating realistic text via adversarial training. We employ a long
  short-term memory network as generator, and a convolutional network as discriminator.
  Instead of using the standard objective of GAN, we propose matching the high-dimensional
  latent feature distributions of real and synthetic sentences, via a kernelized discrepancy
  metric. This eases adversarial training by alleviating the mode-collapsing problem.
  Our experiments show superior performance in quantitative evaluation, and demonstrate
  that our model can generate realistic-looking sentences.
