abstract: 'Graphical models with latent count variables arise in a number of areas.
  However, standard inference algorithms do not apply to these models due to the infinite
  support of the latent variables. Winner and Sheldon (2016) recently developed a
  new technique using probability generating functions (PGFs) to perform efficient,
  exact inference for certain Poisson latent variable models. However, the method
  relies on symbolic manipulation of PGFs, and it is unclear whether this can be extended
  to more general models. In this paper we introduce a new approach for inference
  with PGFs: instead of manipulating PGFs symbolically, we adapt techniques from the
  autodiff literature to compute the higher-order derivatives necessary for inference.
  This substantially generalizes the class of models for which efficient, exact inference
  algorithms are available. Specifically, our results apply to a class of models that
  includes branching processes, which are widely used in applied mathematics and population
  ecology, and autoregressive models for integer data. Experiments show that our techniques
  are more scalable than existing approximate methods and enable new applications.'
