abstract: 'We address the problem of learning a ranking by using adaptively chosen
  pairwise comparisons. Our goal is to recover the ranking accurately but to sample
  the comparisons sparingly. If all comparison outcomes are consistent with the ranking,
  the optimal solution is to use an efficient sorting algorithm, such as Quicksort.
  But how do sorting algorithms behave if some comparison outcomes are inconsistent
  with the ranking? We give favorable guarantees for Quicksort for the popular Bradley-Terry
  model, under natural assumptions on the parameters. Furthermore, we empirically
  demonstrate that sorting algorithms lead to a very simple and effective active learning
  strategy: repeatedly sort the items. This strategy performs as well as state-of-the-art
  methods (and much better than random sampling) at a minuscule fraction of the computational
  cost.'
