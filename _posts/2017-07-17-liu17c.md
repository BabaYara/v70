abstract: We introduce a notion of algorithmic stability of learning algorithms—that
  we term <em>hypothesis stability</em>—that captures stability of the hypothesis
  output by the learning algorithm in the normed space of functions from which hypotheses
  are selected. The main result of the paper bounds the generalization error of any
  learning algorithm in terms of its hypothesis stability. The bounds are based on
  martingale inequalities in the Banach space to which the hypotheses belong. We apply
  the general bounds to bound the performance of some learning algorithms based on
  empirical risk minimization and stochastic gradient descent.
