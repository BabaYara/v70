abstract: Most exact methods for k-nearest neighbour search suffer from the curse
  of dimensionality; that is, their query times exhibit exponential dependence on
  either the ambient or the intrinsic dimensionality. Dynamic Continuous Indexing
  (DCI) offers a promising way of circumventing the curse and successfully reduces
  the dependence of query time on intrinsic dimensionality from exponential to sublinear.
  In this paper, we propose a variant of DCI, which we call Prioritized DCI, and show
  a remarkable improvement in the dependence of query time on intrinsic dimensionality.
  In particular, a linear increase in intrinsic dimensionality, or equivalently, an
  exponential increase in the number of points near a query, can be mostly counteracted
  with just a linear increase in space. We also demonstrate empirically that Prioritized
  DCI significantly outperforms prior methods. In particular, relative to Locality-Sensitive
  Hashing (LSH), Prioritized DCI reduces the number of distance evaluations by a factor
  of 14 to 116 and the memory consumption by a factor of 21.
