abstract: 'We propose a new approximate inference algorithm for graphical models,
  tensor belief propagation, based on approximating the messages passed in the junction
  tree algorithm. Our algorithm represents the potential functions of the graphical
  model and all messages on the junction tree compactly as mixtures of rank-1 tensors.
  Using this representation, we show how to perform the operations required for inference
  on the junction tree efficiently: marginalisation can be computed quickly due to
  the factored form of rank-1 tensors while multiplication can be approximated using
  sampling. Our analysis gives sufficient conditions for the algorithm to perform
  well, including for the case of high-treewidth graphs, for which exact inference
  is intractable. We compare our algorithm experimentally with several approximate
  inference algorithms and show that it performs well.'
