abstract: We present a deterministic nearly-linear time algorithm for approximating
  any point inside a convex polytope with a sparse convex combination of the polytope’s
  vertices. Our result provides a constructive proof for the Approximate Carathéodory
  Problem, which states that any point inside a polytope contained in the $\ell_p$
  ball of radius $D$ can be approximated to within $ε$ in $\ell_p$ norm by a convex
  combination of $O\left(D^2 p/ε^2\right)$ vertices of the polytope for $p ≥2$. While
  for the particular case of $p=2$, this can be achieved by the well-known Perceptron
  algorithm, we follow a more principled approach which generalizes to arbitrary $p≥2$;
  furthermore, this naturally extends to domains with more complicated geometry, as
  it is the case for providing an approximate Birkhoff-von Neumann decomposition.
  Secondly, we show that the sparsity bound is tight for $\ell_p$ norms, using an
  argument based on anti-concentration for the binomial distribution, thus resolving
  an open question posed by Barman. Experimentally, we verify that our deterministic
  optimization-based algorithms achieve in practice much better sparsity than previously
  known sampling-based algorithms. We also show how to apply our techniques to SVM
  training and rounding fractional points in matroid and flow polytopes.
