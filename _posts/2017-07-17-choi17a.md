abstract: The past decade has seen a significant interest in learning tractable probabilistic
  representations. Arithmetic circuits (ACs) were among the first proposed tractable
  representations, with some subsequent representations being instances of ACs with
  weaker or stronger properties. In this paper, we provide a formal basis under which
  variants on ACs can be compared, and where the precise roles and semantics of their
  various properties can be made more transparent. This allows us to place some recent
  developments on ACs in a clearer perspective and to also derive new results for
  ACs. This includes an exponential separation between ACs with and without determinism;
  completeness and incompleteness results; and tractability results (or lack thereof)
  when computing most probable explanations (MPEs).
