abstract: In this work we study the safe sequential decision making problem under
  the setting of adversarial contextual bandits with sequential risk constraints.
  At each round, nature prepares a context, a cost for each arm, and additionally
  a risk for each arm. The learner leverages the context to pull an arm and receives
  the corresponding cost and risk associated with the pulled arm. In addition to minimizing
  the cumulative cost, for safety purposes, the learner needs to make safe decisions
  such that the average of the cumulative risk from all pulled arms should not be
  larger than a pre-defined threshold. To address this problem, we first study online
  convex programming in the full information setting where in each round the learner
  receives an adversarial convex loss and a convex constraint. We develop a meta algorithm
  leveraging online mirror descent for the full information setting and then extend
  it to contextual bandit with sequential risk constraints setting using expert advice.
  Our algorithms can achieve near-optimal regret in terms of minimizing the total
  cost, while successfully maintaining a sub-linear growth of accumulative risk constraint
  violation. We support our theoretical results by demonstrating our algorithm on
  a simple simulated robotics reactive control task.
