abstract: We study the set of all decompositions (clusterings) of a graph through
  its characterization as a set of lifted multicuts. This leads us to practically
  relevant insights related to the definition of classes of decompositions by must-join
  and must-cut constraints and related to the comparison of clusterings by metrics.
  To find optimal decompositions defined by minimum cost lifted multicuts, we establish
  some properties of some facets of lifted multicut polytopes, define efficient separation
  procedures and apply these in a branch-and-cut algorithm.
