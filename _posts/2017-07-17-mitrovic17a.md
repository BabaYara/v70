abstract: Many data summarization applications are captured by the general framework
  of submodular maximization. As a consequence, a wide range of efficient approximation
  algorithms have been developed. However, when such applications involve sensitive
  data about individuals, their privacy concerns are not automatically addressed.
  To remedy this problem, we propose a general and systematic study of differentially
  private submodular maximization. We present privacy-preserving algorithms for both
  monotone and non-monotone submodular maximization under cardinality, matroid, and
  p-extendible system constraints, with guarantees that are competitive with optimal.
  Along the way, we analyze a new algorithm for non-monotone submodular maximization,
  which is the first (even non-privately) to achieve a constant approximation ratio
  while running in linear time. We additionally provide two concrete experiments to
  validate the efficacy of these algorithms.
