abstract: We propose a hierarchical approach for making long-term predictions of future
  frames. To avoid inherent compounding errors in recursive pixel-level prediction,
  we propose to first estimate high-level structure in the input frames, then predict
  how that structure evolves in the future, and finally by observing a single frame
  from the past and the predicted high-level structure, we construct the future frames
  without having to observe any of the pixel-level predictions. Long-term video prediction
  is difficult to perform by recurrently observing the predicted frames because the
  small errors in pixel space exponentially amplify as predictions are made deeper
  into the future. Our approach prevents pixel-level error propagation from happening
  by removing the need to observe the predicted frames. Our model is built with a
  combination of LSTM and analogy based encoder-decoder convolutional neural networks,
  which independently predict the video structure and generate the future frames,
  respectively. In experiments, our model is evaluated on the Human3.6M and Penn Action
  datasets on the task of long-term pixel-level video prediction of humans performing
  actions and demonstrate significantly better results than the state-of-the-art.
