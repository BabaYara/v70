abstract: 'Motivated by the need for distributed learning and optimization algorithms
  with low communication cost, we study communication efficient algorithms for distributed
  mean estimation. Unlike previous works, we make no probabilistic assumptions on
  the data. We first show that for $d$ dimensional data with $n$ clients, a naive
  stochastic rounding approach yields a mean squared error (MSE) of $Θ(d/n)$ and uses
  a constant number of bits per dimension per client. We then extend this naive algorithm
  in two ways: we show that applying a structured random rotation before quantization
  reduces the error to $\mathcalO((\log d)/n)$ and a better coding strategy further
  reduces the error to $\mathcalO(1/n)$. We also show that the latter coding strategy
  is optimal up to a constant in the minimax sense i.e., it achieves the best MSE
  for a given communication cost. We finally demonstrate the practicality of our algorithms
  by applying them to distributed Lloyd’s algorithm for k-means and power iteration
  for PCA.'
