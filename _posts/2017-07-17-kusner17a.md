abstract: Deep generative models have been wildly successful at learning coherent
  latent representations for continuous data such as natural images, artwork, and
  audio. However, generative modeling of discrete data such as arithmetic expressions
  and molecular structures still poses significant challenges. Crucially, state-of-the-art
  methods often produce outputs that are not valid. We make the key observation that
  frequently, discrete data can be represented as a parse tree from a context-free
  grammar. We propose a variational autoencoder which directly encodes from and decodes
  to these parse trees, ensuring the generated outputs are always syntactically valid.
  Surprisingly, we show that not only does our model more often generate valid outputs,
  it also learns a more coherent latent space in which nearby points decode to similar
  discrete outputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our learned models by showing
  their improved performance in Bayesian optimization for symbolic regression and
  molecule generation.
