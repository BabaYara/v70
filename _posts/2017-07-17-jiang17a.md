abstract: 'We show that DBSCAN can estimate the connected components of the $λ$-density
  level set ${ x : f(x) \ge λ}$ given $n$ i.i.d. samples from an unknown density $f$.
  We characterize the regularity of the level set boundaries using parameter $β> 0$
  and analyze the estimation error under the Hausdorff metric. When the data lies
  in $\mathbbR^D$ we obtain a rate of $\widetildeO(n^-1/(2β+ D))$, which matches known
  lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. When the data lies on an embedded unknown
  $d$-dimensional manifold in $\mathbbR^D$, then we obtain a rate of $\widetildeO(n^-1/(2β+
  d⋅\max{1, β}))$. Finally, we provide adaptive parameter tuning in order to attain
  these rates with no a priori knowledge of the intrinsic dimension, density, or $β$.'
