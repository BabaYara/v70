abstract: 'We show that DBSCAN can estimate the connected components of the $\lambda$-density
  level set $\{ x : f(x) \ge \lambda\}$ given $n$ i.i.d. samples from an unknown density
  $f$. We characterize the regularity of the level set boundaries using parameter
  $\beta &gt; 0$ and analyze the estimation error under the Hausdorff metric. When
  the data lies in $\mathbb{R}^D$ we obtain a rate of $\widetilde{O}(n^{-1/(2\beta
  + D)})$, which matches known lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. When the data
  lies on an embedded unknown $d$-dimensional manifold in $\mathbb{R}^D$, then we
  obtain a rate of $\widetilde{O}(n^{-1/(2\beta + d\cdot \max\{1, \beta \})})$. Finally,
  we provide adaptive parameter tuning in order to attain these rates with no a priori
  knowledge of the intrinsic dimension, density, or $\beta$.'
