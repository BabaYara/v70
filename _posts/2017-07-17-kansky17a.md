abstract: The recent adaptation of deep neural network-based methods to reinforcement
  learning and planning domains has yielded remarkable progress on individual tasks.
  Nonetheless, progress on task-to-task transfer remains limited. In pursuit of efficient
  and robust generalization, we introduce the Schema Network, an object-oriented generative
  physics simulator capable of disentangling multiple causes of events and reasoning
  backward through causes to achieve goals. The richly structured architecture of
  the Schema Network can learn the dynamics of an environment directly from data.
  We compare Schema Networks with Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic and Progressive
  Networks on a suite of Breakout variations, reporting results on training efficiency
  and zero-shot generalization, consistently demonstrating faster, more robust learning
  and better transfer. We argue that generalizing from limited data and learning causal
  relationships are essential abilities on the path toward generally intelligent systems.
