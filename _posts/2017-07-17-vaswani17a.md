abstract: We consider <em>influence maximization</em> (IM) in social networks, which
  is the problem of maximizing the number of users that become aware of a product
  by selecting a set of “seed” users to expose the product to. While prior work assumes
  a known model of information diffusion, we propose a novel parametrization that
  not only makes our framework agnostic to the underlying diffusion model, but also
  statistically efficient to learn from data. We give a corresponding monotone, submodular
  surrogate function, and show that it is a good approximation to the original IM
  objective. We also consider the case of a new marketer looking to exploit an existing
  social network, while simultaneously learning the factors governing information
  propagation. For this, we propose a pairwise-influence semi-bandit feedback model
  and develop a LinUCB-based bandit algorithm. Our model-independent analysis shows
  that our regret bound has a better (as compared to previous work) dependence on
  the size of the network. Experimental evaluation suggests that our framework is
  robust to the underlying diffusion model and can efficiently learn a near-optimal
  solution.
