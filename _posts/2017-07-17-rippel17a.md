abstract: 'We present a machine learning-based approach to lossy image compression
  which outperforms all existing codecs, while running in real-time. Our algorithm
  typically produces file sizes 3 times smaller than JPEG, 2.5 times smaller than
  JPEG 2000, and 2.3 times smaller than WebP on datasets of generic images across
  a spectrum of quality levels. At the same time, our codec is designed to be lightweight
  and deployable: for example, it can encode or decode the Kodak dataset in less than
  10ms per image on GPU. Our architecture is an autoencoder featuring pyramidal analysis,
  an adaptive coding module, and regularization of the expected codelength. We also
  supplement our approach with adversarial training specialized towards use in a compression
  setting: this enables us to produce visually pleasing reconstructions for very low
  bitrates.'
