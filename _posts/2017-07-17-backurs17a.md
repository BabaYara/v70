abstract: The classic algorithm of Viterbi computes the most likely path in a Hidden
  Markov Model (HMM) that results in a given sequence of observations. It runs in
  time $O(Tn^2)$ given a sequence of T observations from a HMM with n states. Despite
  significant interest in the problem and prolonged effort by different communities,
  no known algorithm achieves more than a polylogarithmic speedup. In this paper,
  we explain this difficulty by providing matching conditional lower bounds. Our lower
  bounds are based on assumptions that the best known algorithms for the All-Pairs
  Shortest Paths problem (APSP) and for the Max-Weight k-Clique problem in edge-weighted
  graphs are essentially tight. Finally, using a recent algorithm by Green Larsen
  and Williams for online Boolean matrix-vector multiplication, we get a $2^Î©(\sqrt\log
  n)$ speedup for the Viterbi algorithm when there are few distinct transition probabilities
  in the HMM.
