abstract: 'Probabilistic modeling is cyclical: we specify a model, infer its posterior,
  and evaluate its performance. Evaluation drives the cycle, as we revise our model
  based on how it performs. This requires a metric. Traditionally, predictive accuracy
  prevails. Yet, predictive accuracy does not tell the whole story. We propose to
  evaluate a model through posterior dispersion. The idea is to analyze how each datapoint
  fares in relation to posterior uncertainty around the hidden structure. This highlights
  datapoints the model struggles to explain and provides complimentary insight to
  datapoints with low predictive accuracy. We present a family of posterior dispersion
  indices (PDI) that capture this idea. We show how a PDI identifies patterns of model
  mismatch in three real data examples: voting preferences, supermarket shopping,
  and population genetics.'
