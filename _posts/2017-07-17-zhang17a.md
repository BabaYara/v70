abstract: Scaling Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to estimate posterior distributions
  from large datasets has been made possible as a result of advances in stochastic
  gradient techniques. Despite their success, mixing performance of existing methods
  when sampling from multimodal distributions can be less efficient with insufficient
  Monte Carlo samples; this is evidenced by slow convergence and insufficient exploration
  of posterior distributions. We propose a generalized framework to improve the sampling
  efficiency of stochastic gradient MCMC, by leveraging a generalized kinetics that
  delivers superior stationary mixing, especially in multimodal distributions, and
  propose several techniques to overcome the practical issues. We show that the proposed
  approach is better at exploring a complicated multimodal posterior distribution,
  and demonstrate improvements over other stochastic gradient MCMC methods on various
  applications.
