abstract: We present a scalable end-to-end classifier that uses streaming physiological
  and medication data to accurately predict the onset of sepsis, a life-threatening
  complication from infections that has high mortality and morbidity. Our proposed
  framework models the multivariate trajectories of continuous-valued physiological
  time series using multitask Gaussian processes, seamlessly accounting for the high
  uncertainty, frequent missingness, and irregular sampling rates typically associated
  with real clinical data. The Gaussian process is directly connected to a black-box
  classifier that predicts whether a patient will become septic, chosen in our case
  to be a recurrent neural network to account for the extreme variability in the length
  of patient encounters. We show how to scale the computations associated with the
  Gaussian process in a manner so that the entire system can be discriminatively trained
  end-to-end using backpropagation. In a large cohort of heterogeneous inpatient encounters
  at our university health system we find that it outperforms several baselines at
  predicting sepsis, and yields 19.4\% and 55.5\% improved areas under the Receiver
  Operating Characteristic and Precision Recall curves as compared to the NEWS score
  currently used by our hospital.
