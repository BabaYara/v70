abstract: We focus on predicting sleep stages from radio measurements without any
  attached sensors on subjects. We introduce a new predictive model that combines
  convolutional and recurrent neural networks to extract sleep-specific subject-invariant
  features from RF signals and capture the temporal progression of sleep. A key innovation
  underlying our approach is a modified adversarial training regime that discards
  extraneous information specific to individuals or measurement conditions, while
  retaining all information relevant to the predictive task. We analyze our game theoretic
  setup and empirically demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements
  over state-of-the-art solutions.
