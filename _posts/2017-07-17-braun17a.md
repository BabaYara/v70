abstract: Conditional gradient algorithms (also often called Frank-Wolfe algorithms)
  are popular due to their simplicity of only requiring a linear optimization oracle
  and more recently they also gained significant traction for online learning. While
  simple in principle, in many cases the actual implementation of the linear optimization
  oracle is costly. We show a general method to lazify various conditional gradient
  algorithms, which in actual computations leads to several orders of magnitude of
  speedup in wall-clock time. This is achieved by using a faster separation oracle
  instead of a linear optimization oracle, relying only on few linear optimization
  oracle calls.
