abstract: 'Most existing sequence labelling models rely on a fixed decomposition of
  a target sequence into a sequence of basic units. These methods suffer from two
  major drawbacks: $1$) the set of basic units is fixed, such as the set of words,
  characters or phonemes in speech recognition, and $2$) the decomposition of target
  sequences is fixed. These drawbacks usually result in sub-optimal performance of
  modeling sequences. In this paper, we extend the popular CTC loss criterion to alleviate
  these limitations, and propose a new loss function called <em>Gram-CTC</em>. While
  preserving the advantages of CTC, Gram-CTC automatically learns the best set of
  basic units (grams), as well as the most suitable decomposition of target sequences.
  Unlike CTC, Gram-CTC allows the model to output variable number of characters at
  each time step, which enables the model to capture longer term dependency and improves
  the computational efficiency. We demonstrate that the proposed Gram-CTC improves
  CTC in terms of both performance and efficiency on the large vocabulary speech recognition
  task at multiple scales of data, and that with Gram-CTC we can outperform the state-of-the-art
  on a standard speech benchmark.'
