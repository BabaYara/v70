abstract: Understanding the geometry of neural network loss surfaces is important
  for the development of improved optimization algorithms and for building a theoretical
  understanding of why deep learning works. In this paper, we study the geometry in
  terms of the distribution of eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at critical points
  of varying energy. We introduce an analytical framework and a set of tools from
  random matrix theory that allow us to compute an approximation of this distribution
  under a set of simplifying assumptions. The shape of the spectrum depends strongly
  on the energy and another key parameter, $\phi$, which measures the ratio of parameters
  to data points. Our analysis predicts and numerical simulations support that for
  critical points of small index, the number of negative eigenvalues scales like the
  3/2 power of the energy. We leave as an open problem an explanation for our observation
  that, in the context of a certain memorization task, the energy of minimizers is
  well-approximated by the function $1/2(1-\phi)^2$.
