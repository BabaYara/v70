abstract: 'A data-driven identification of dynamical systems requiring only minimal
  prior knowledge is promising whenever no analytically derived model structure is
  available, e.g., from first principles in physics. However, meta-knowledge on the
  systemâ€™s behavior is often given and should be exploited: Stability as fundamental
  property is essential when the model is used for controller design or movement generation.
  Therefore, this paper proposes a framework for learning stable stochastic systems
  from data. We focus on identifying a state-dependent coefficient form of the nonlinear
  stochastic model which is globally asymptotically stable according to probabilistic
  Lyapunov methods. We compare our approach to other state of the art methods on real-world
  datasets in terms of flexibility and stability.'
