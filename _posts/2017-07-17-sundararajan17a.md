abstract: We study the problem of attributing the prediction of a deep network to
  its input features, a problem previously studied by several other works. We identify
  two fundamental axiomsâ€”Sensitivity and Implementation Invariance that attribution
  methods ought to satisfy. We show that they are not satisfied by most known attribution
  methods, which we consider to be a fundamental weakness of those methods. We use
  the axioms to guide the design of a new attribution method called Integrated Gradients.
  Our method requires no modification to the original network and is extremely simple
  to implement; it just needs a few calls to the standard gradient operator. We apply
  this method to a couple of image models, a couple of text models and a chemistry
  model, demonstrating its ability to debug networks, to extract rules from a network,
  and to enable users to engage with models better.
