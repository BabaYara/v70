abstract: This paper shows that a perturbed form of gradient descent converges to
  a second-order stationary point in a number iterations which depends only poly-logarithmically
  on dimension (i.e., it is almost “dimension-free”). The convergence rate of this
  procedure matches the well-known convergence rate of gradient descent to first-order
  stationary points, up to log factors. When all saddle points are non-degenerate,
  all second-order stationary points are local minima, and our result thus shows that
  perturbed gradient descent can escape saddle points almost for free. Our results
  can be directly applied to many machine learning applications, including deep learning.
  As a particular concrete example of such an application, we show that our results
  can be used directly to establish sharp global convergence rates for matrix factorization.
  Our results rely on a novel characterization of the geometry around saddle points,
  which may be of independent interest to the non-convex optimization community.
