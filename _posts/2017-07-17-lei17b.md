abstract: We consider the popular problem of sparse empirical risk minimization with
  linear predictors and a large number of both features and observations. With a convex-concave
  saddle point objective reformulation, we propose a Doubly Greedy Primal-Dual Coordinate
  Descent algorithm that is able to exploit sparsity in both primal and dual variables.
  It enjoys a low cost per iteration and our theoretical analysis shows that it converges
  linearly with a good iteration complexity, provided that the set of primal variables
  is sparse. We then extend this algorithm further to leverage active sets. The resulting
  new algorithm is even faster, and experiments on large-scale Multi-class data sets
  show that our algorithm achieves up to 30 times speedup on several state-of-the-art
  optimization methods.
