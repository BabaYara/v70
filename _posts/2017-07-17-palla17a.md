abstract: We propose a Bayesian nonparametric prior over feature allocations for sequential
  data, the birth-death feature allocation process (BDFP). The BDFP models the evolution
  of the feature allocation of a set of N objects across a covariate (e.g.Â time) by
  creating and deleting features. A BDFP is exchangeable, projective, stationary and
  reversible, and its equilibrium distribution is given by the Indian buffet process
  (IBP). We show that the Beta process on an extended space is the de Finetti mixing
  distribution underlying the BDFP. Finally, we present the finite approximation of
  the BDFP, the Beta Event Process (BEP), that permits simplified inference. The utility
  of the BDFP as a prior is demonstrated on real world dynamic genomics and social
  network data.
