abstract: The Gumbel trick is a method to sample from a discrete probability distribution,
  or to estimate its normalizing partition function. The method relies on repeatedly
  applying a random perturbation to the distribution in a particular way, each time
  solving for the most likely configuration. We derive an entire family of related
  methods, of which the Gumbel trick is one member, and show that the new methods
  have superior properties in several settings with minimal additional computational
  cost. In particular, for the Gumbel trick to yield computational benefits for discrete
  graphical models, Gumbel perturbations on all configurations are typically replaced
  with so-called low-rank perturbations. We show how a subfamily of our new methods
  adapts to this setting, proving new upper and lower bounds on the log partition
  function and deriving a family of sequential samplers for the Gibbs distribution.
  Finally, we balance the discussion by showing how the simpler analytical form of
  the Gumbel trick enables additional theoretical results.
