abstract: We consider $(ε,δ)$-PAC maximum-selection and ranking using pairwise comparisons
  for general probabilistic models whose comparison probabilities satisfy strong stochastic
  transitivity and stochastic triangle inequality. Modifying the popular knockout
  tournament, we propose a simple maximum-selection algorithm that uses $\mathcalO\left(\fracnε^2
  \left(1+\log \frac1δ\right)\right)$ comparisons, optimal up to a constant factor.
  We then derive a general framework that uses noisy binary search to speed up many
  ranking algorithms, and combine it with merge sort to obtain a ranking algorithm
  that uses $\mathcalO\left(\frac nε^2\log n(\log \log n)^3\right)$ comparisons for
  $δ=\frac1n$, optimal up to a $(\log \log n)^3$ factor.
