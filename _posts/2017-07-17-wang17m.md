abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown extraordinary performance
  in a number of applications, but they are usually of heavy design for the accuracy
  reason. Beyond compressing the filters in CNNs, this paper focuses on the redundancy
  in the feature maps derived from the large number of filters in a layer. We propose
  to extract intrinsic representation of the feature maps and preserve the discriminability
  of the features. Circulant matrix is employed to formulate the feature map transformation,
  which only requires O(dlog d) computation complexity to embed a d-dimensional feature
  map. The filter is then re-configured to establish the mapping from original input
  to the new compact feature map, and the resulting network can preserve intrinsic
  information of the original network with significantly fewer parameters, which not
  only decreases the online memory for launching CNN but also accelerates the computation
  speed. Experiments on benchmark image datasets demonstrate the superiority of the
  proposed algorithm over state-of-the-art methods.
