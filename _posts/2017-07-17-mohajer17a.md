abstract: 'We explore an active top-$K$ ranking problem based on pairwise comparisons
  that are collected possibly in a sequential manner as per our design choice. We
  consider two settings: (1) \emphtop-$K$ sorting in which the goal is to recover
  the top-$K$ items in order out of $n$ items; (2) \emphtop-$K$ partitioning where
  only the set of top-$K$ items is desired. Under a fairly general model which subsumes
  as special cases various models (e.g., Strong Stochastic Transitivity model, BTL
  model and uniform noise model), we characterize upper bounds on the sample size
  required for top-$K$ sorting as well as for top-$K$ partitioning. As a consequence,
  we demonstrate that active ranking can offer significant multiplicative gains in
  sample complexity over passive ranking. Depending on the underlying stochastic noise
  model, such gain varies from around $\frac\log n\log \log n$ to $\frac n^2 \log
  n \log \log n$. We also present an algorithm that is applicable to both settings.'
