abstract: 'We present spectral methods of moments for learning sequential models from
  a single trajectory, in stark contrast with the classical literature that assumes
  the availability of multiple i.i.d. trajectories. Our approach leverages an efficient
  SVD-based learning algorithm for weighted automata and provides the first rigorous
  analysis for learning many important models using dependent data. We state and analyze
  the algorithm under three increasingly difficult scenarios: probabilistic automata,
  stochastic weighted automata, and reactive predictive state representations controlled
  by a finite-state policy. Our proofs include novel tools for studying mixing properties
  of stochastic weighted automata.'
