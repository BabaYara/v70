abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged during the last few years as an effective
  approach to optimize black-box functions where direct queries of the objective are
  expensive. We consider the case where direct access to the function is not possible,
  but information about user preferences is. Such scenarios arise in problems where
  human preferences are modeled, such as A/B tests or recommender systems. We present
  a new framework for this scenario that we call Preferential Bayesian Optimization
  (PBO) and that allows to find the optimum of a latent function that can only be
  queried through pairwise comparisons, so-called duels. PBO extend the applicability
  of standard BO ideas and generalizes previous discrete dueling approaches by modeling
  the probability of the the winner of each duel by means of Gaussian process model
  with a Bernoulli likelihood. The latent preference function is used to define a
  family of acquisition functions that extend usual policies used in BO. We illustrate
  the benefits of PBO in a variety of experiments in which we show how the way correlations
  are modeled is the key ingredient to drastically reduce the number of comparisons
  to find the optimum of the latent function of interest.
