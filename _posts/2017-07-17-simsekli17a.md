abstract: 'Along with the recent advances in scalable Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods,
  sampling techniques that are based on Langevin diffusions have started receiving
  increasing attention. These so called Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) methods are based
  on diffusions driven by a Brownian motion, which gives rise to Gaussian proposal
  distributions in the resulting algorithms. Even though these approaches have proven
  successful in many applications, their performance can be limited by the light-tailed
  nature of the Gaussian proposals. In this study, we extend classical LMC and develop
  a novel Fractional LMC (FLMC) framework that is based on a family of heavy-tailed
  distributions, called alpha-stable Levy distributions. As opposed to classical approaches,
  the proposed approach can possess large jumps while targeting the correct distribution,
  which would be beneficial for efficient exploration of the state space. We develop
  novel computational methods that can scale up to large-scale problems and we provide
  formal convergence analysis of the proposed scheme. Our experiments support our
  theory: FLMC can provide superior performance in multi-modal settings, improved
  convergence rates, and robustness to algorithm parameters.'
