abstract: Infinite Layer Networks (ILN) have been proposed as an architecture that
  mimics neural networks while enjoying some of the advantages of kernel methods.
  ILN are networks that integrate over infinitely many nodes within a single hidden
  layer. It has been demonstrated by several authors that the problem of learning
  ILN can be reduced to the kernel trick, implying that whenever a certain integral
  can be computed analytically they are efficiently learnable. In this work we give
  an online algorithm for ILN, which avoids the kernel trick assumption. More generally
  and of independent interest, we show that kernel methods in general can be exploited
  even when the kernel cannot be efficiently computed but can only be estimated via
  sampling. We provide a regret analysis for our algorithm, showing that it matches
  the sample complexity of methods which have access to kernel values. Thus, our method
  is the first to demonstrate that the kernel trick is not necessary, as such, and
  random features suffice to obtain comparable performance.
