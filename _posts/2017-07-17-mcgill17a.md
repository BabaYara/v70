abstract: 'We propose and systematically evaluate three strategies for training dynamically-routed
  artificial neural networks: graphs of learned transformations through which different
  input signals may take different paths. Though some approaches have advantages over
  others, the resulting networks are often qualitatively similar. We find that, in
  dynamically-routed networks trained to classify images, layers and branches become
  specialized to process distinct categories of images. Additionally, given a fixed
  computational budget, dynamically-routed networks tend to perform better than comparable
  statically-routed networks.'
