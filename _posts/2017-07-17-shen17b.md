abstract: In this paper, we propose a fast \bfGauss-\bfSeidel \bfOperator \bfSplitting
  (GSOS) algorithm for addressing multi-term nonsmooth convex composite optimization,
  which has wide applications in machine learning, signal processing and statistics.
  The proposed GSOS algorithm inherits the advantage of the Gauss-Seidel technique
  to accelerate the optimization procedure, and leverages the operator splitting technique
  to reduce the computational complexity. In addition, we develop a new technique
  to establish the global convergence of the GSOS algorithm. To be specific, we first
  reformulate the iterations of GSOS as a two-step iterations algorithm by employing
  the tool of operator optimization theory. Subsequently, we establish the convergence
  of GSOS based on the two-step iterations algorithm reformulation. At last, we apply
  the proposed GSOS algorithm to solve overlapping group Lasso and graph-guided fused
  Lasso problems. Numerical experiments show that our proposed GSOS algorithm is superior
  to the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness.
