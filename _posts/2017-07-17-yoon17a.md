abstract: The number of parameters in a deep neural network is usually very large,
  which helps with its learning capacity but also hinders its scalability and practicality
  due to memory/time inefficiency and overfitting. To resolve this issue, we propose
  a sparsity regularization method that exploits both positive and negative correlations
  among the features to enforce the network to be sparse, and at the same time remove
  any redundancies among the features to fully utilize the capacity of the network.
  Specifically, we propose to use an exclusive sparsity regularization based on (1,2)-norm,
  which promotes competition for features between different weights, thus enforcing
  them to fit to disjoint sets of features. We further combine the exclusive sparsity
  with the group sparsity based on (2,1)-norm, to promote both sharing and competition
  for features in training of a deep neural network. We validate our method on multiple
  public datasets, and the results show that our method can obtain more compact and
  efficient networks while also improving the performance over the base networks with
  full weights, as opposed to existing sparsity regularizations that often obtain
  efficiency at the expense of prediction accuracy.
