abstract: We propose a hierarchical generative model that captures the self-similar
  structure of image regions as well as how this structure is shared across image
  collections. Our model is based on a novel, variational interpretation of the popular
  expected patch log-likelihood (EPLL) method as a model for randomly positioned grids
  of image patches. While previous EPLL methods modeled image patches with finite
  Gaussian mixtures, we use nonparametric Dirichlet process (DP) mixtures to create
  models whose complexity grows as additional images are observed. An extension based
  on the hierarchical DP then captures repetitive and self-similar structure via image-specific
  variations in cluster frequencies. We derive a structured variational inference
  algorithm that adaptively creates new patch clusters to more accurately model novel
  image textures. Our denoising performance on standard benchmarks is superior to
  EPLL and comparable to the state-of-the-art, and provides novel statistical justifications
  for common image processing heuristics. We also show accurate image inpainting results.
