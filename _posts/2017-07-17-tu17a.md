abstract: Recent work by Nesterov and Stich (2016) showed that momentum can be used
  to accelerate the rate of convergence for block Gauss-Seidel in the setting where
  a fixed partitioning of the coordinates is chosen ahead of time. We show that this
  setting is too restrictive, constructing instances where breaking locality by running
  non-accelerated Gauss-Seidel with randomly sampled coordinates substantially outperforms
  accelerated Gauss-Seidel with any fixed partitioning. Motivated by this finding,
  we analyze the accelerated block Gauss-Seidel algorithm in the random coordinate
  sampling setting. Our analysis captures the benefit of acceleration with a new data-dependent
  parameter which is well behaved when the matrix sub-blocks are well-conditioned.
  Empirically, we show that accelerated Gauss-Seidel with random coordinate sampling
  provides speedups for large scale machine learning tasks when compared to non-accelerated
  Gauss-Seidel and the classical conjugate-gradient algorithm.
