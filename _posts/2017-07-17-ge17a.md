abstract: 'In this paper we develop a new framework that captures the common landscape
  underlying the common non-convex low-rank matrix problems including matrix sensing,
  matrix completion and robust PCA. In particular, we show for all above problems
  (including asymmetric cases): 1) all local minima are also globally optimal; 2)
  no high-order saddle points exists. These results explain why simple algorithms
  such as stochastic gradient descent have global converge, and efficiently optimize
  these non-convex objective functions in practice. Our framework connects and simplifies
  the existing analyses on optimization landscapes for matrix sensing and symmetric
  matrix completion. The framework naturally leads to new results for asymmetric matrix
  completion and robust PCA.'
