abstract: Symmetric distribution properties such as support size, support coverage,
  entropy, and proximity to uniformity, arise in many applications. Recently, researchers
  applied different estimators and analysis tools to derive asymptotically sample-optimal
  approximations for each of these properties. We show that a single, simple, plug-in
  estimator—<em>profile maximum likelihood (PML)</em>—is sample competitive for all
  symmetric properties, and in particular is asymptotically sample-optimal for all
  the above properties.
