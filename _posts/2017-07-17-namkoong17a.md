abstract: Standard forms of coordinate and stochastic gradient methods do not adapt
  to structure in data; their good behavior under random sampling is predicated on
  uniformity in data. When gradients in certain blocks of features (for coordinate
  descent) or examples (for SGD) are larger than others, there is a natural structure
  that can be exploited for quicker convergence. Yet adaptive variants often suffer
  nontrivial computational overhead. We present a framework that discovers and leverages
  such structural properties at a low computational cost. We employ a bandit optimization
  procedure that “learns” probabilities for sampling coordinates or examples in (non-smooth)
  optimization problems, allowing us to guarantee performance close to that of the
  optimal stationary sampling distribution. When such structures exist, our algorithms
  achieve tighter convergence guarantees than their non-adaptive counterparts, and
  we complement our analysis with experiments on several datasets.
