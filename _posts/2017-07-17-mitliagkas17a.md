abstract: The pairwise influence matrix of Dobrushin has long been used as an analytical
  tool to bound the rate of convergence of Gibbs sampling. In this work, we use Dobrushin
  influence as the basis of a practical tool to certify and efficiently improve the
  quality of a Gibbs sampler. Our Dobrushin-optimized Gibbs samplers (DoGS) offer
  customized variable selection orders for a given sampling budget and variable subset
  of interest, explicit bounds on total variation distance to stationarity, and certifiable
  improvements over the standard systematic and uniform random scan Gibbs samplers.
  In our experiments with image segmentation, Markov chain Monte Carlo maximum likelihood
  estimation, and Ising model inference, DoGS consistently deliver higher-quality
  inferences with significantly smaller sampling budgets than standard Gibbs samplers.
