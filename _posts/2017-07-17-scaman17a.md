abstract: 'In this paper, we determine the optimal convergence rates for strongly
  convex and smooth distributed optimization in two settings: centralized and decentralized
  communications over a network. For centralized (i.e. master/slave) algorithms, we
  show that distributing Nesterov’s accelerated gradient descent is optimal and achieves
  a precision $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ in time $O(\sqrt{\kappa_g}(1+\Delta\tau)\ln(1/\varepsilon))$,
  where $\kappa_g$ is the condition number of the (global) function to optimize, $\Delta$
  is the diameter of the network, and $\tau$ (resp. $1$) is the time needed to communicate
  values between two neighbors (resp. perform local computations). For decentralized
  algorithms based on gossip, we provide the first optimal algorithm, called the multi-step
  dual accelerated (MSDA) method, that achieves a precision $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ in
  time $O(\sqrt{\kappa_l}(1+\frac{\tau}{\sqrt{\gamma}})\ln(1/\varepsilon))$, where
  $\kappa_l$ is the condition number of the local functions and $\gamma$ is the (normalized)
  eigengap of the gossip matrix used for communication between nodes. We then verify
  the efficiency of MSDA against state-of-the-art methods for two problems: least-squares
  regression and classification by logistic regression.'
