abstract: Recently, researchers have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on
  sequential prediction problems using deep neural networks and Reinforcement Learning
  (RL). For some of these problems, oracles that can demonstrate good performance
  may be available during training, but are not used by plain RL methods. To take
  advantage of this extra information, we propose AggreVaTeD, an extension of the
  Imitation Learning (IL) approach of Ross \& Bagnell (2014). AggreVaTeD allows us
  to use expressive differentiable policy representations such as deep networks, while
  leveraging training-time oracles to achieve faster and more accurate solutions with
  less training data. Specifically, we present two gradient procedures that can learn
  neural network policies for several problems, including a sequential prediction
  task and several high-dimensional robotics control problems. We also provide a comprehensive
  theoretical study of IL that demonstrates that we can expect up to exponentially-lower
  sample complexity for learning with AggreVaTeD than with plain RL algorithms. Our
  results and theory indicate that IL (and AggreVaTeD in particular) can be a more
  effective strategy for sequential prediction than plain RL.
