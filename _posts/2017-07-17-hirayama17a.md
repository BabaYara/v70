abstract: 'We present a novel probabilistic framework for a hierarchical extension
  of independent component analysis (ICA), with a particular motivation in neuroscientific
  data analysis and modeling. The framework incorporates a general subspace pooling
  with linear ICA-like layers stacked recursively. Unlike related previous models,
  our generative model is fully tractable: both the likelihood and the posterior estimates
  of latent variables can readily be computed with analytically simple formulae. The
  model is particularly simple in the case of complex-valued data since the pooling
  can be reduced to taking the modulus of complex numbers. Experiments on electroencephalography
  (EEG) and natural images demonstrate the validity of the method.'
