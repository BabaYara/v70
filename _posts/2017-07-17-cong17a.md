abstract: It is challenging to develop stochastic gradient based scalable inference
  for deep discrete latent variable models (LVMs), due to the difficulties in not
  only computing the gradients, but also adapting the step sizes to different latent
  factors and hidden layers. For the Poisson gamma belief network (PGBN), a recently
  proposed deep discrete LVM, we derive an alternative representation that is referred
  to as deep latent Dirichlet allocation (DLDA). Exploiting data augmentation and
  marginalization techniques, we derive a block-diagonal Fisher information matrix
  and its inverse for the simplex-constrained global model parameters of DLDA. Exploiting
  that Fisher information matrix with stochastic gradient MCMC, we present topic-layer-adaptive
  stochastic gradient Riemannian (TLASGR) MCMC that jointly learns simplex-constrained
  global parameters across all layers and topics, with topic and layer specific learning
  rates. State-of-the-art results are demonstrated on big data sets.
