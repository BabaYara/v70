abstract: 'Deep neural networks (DNNs) have advanced performance on a wide range of
  complex tasks, rapidly outpacing our understanding of the nature of their solutions.
  While past work sought to advance our understanding of these models, none has made
  use of the rich history of problem descriptions, theories, and experimental methods
  developed by cognitive psychologists to study the human mind. To explore the potential
  value of these tools, we chose a well-established analysis from developmental psychology
  that explains how children learn word labels for objects, and applied that analysis
  to DNNs. Using datasets of stimuli inspired by the original cognitive psychology
  experiments, we find that state-of-the-art one shot learning models trained on ImageNet
  exhibit a similar bias to that observed in humans: they prefer to categorize objects
  according to shape rather than color. The magnitude of this shape bias varies greatly
  among architecturally identical, but differently seeded models, and even fluctuates
  within seeds throughout training, despite nearly equivalent classification performance.
  These results demonstrate the capability of tools from cognitive psychology for
  exposing hidden computational properties of DNNs, while concurrently providing us
  with a computational model for human word learning.'
