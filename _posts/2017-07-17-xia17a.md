abstract: Many supervised learning tasks are emerged in dual forms, e.g., English-to-French
  translation vs. French-to-English translation, speech recognition vs. text to speech,
  and image classification vs. image generation. Two dual tasks have intrinsic connections
  with each other due to the probabilistic correlation between their models. This
  connection is, however, not effectively utilized today, since people usually train
  the models of two dual tasks separately and independently. In this work, we propose
  training the models of two dual tasks simultaneously, and explicitly exploiting
  the probabilistic correlation between them to regularize the training process. For
  ease of reference, we call the proposed approach dual supervised learning. We demonstrate
  that dual supervised learning can improve the practical performances of both tasks,
  for various applications including machine translation, image processing, and sentiment
  analysis.
