abstract: We study the off-policy evaluation problem—estimating the value of a target
  policy using data collected by another policy—under the contextual bandit model.
  We consider the general (agnostic) setting without access to a consistent model
  of rewards and establish a minimax lower bound on the mean squared error (MSE).
  The bound is matched up to constants by the inverse propensity scoring (IPS) and
  doubly robust (DR) estimators. This highlights the difficulty of the agnostic contextual
  setting, in contrast with multi-armed bandits and contextual bandits with access
  to a consistent reward model, where IPS is suboptimal. We then propose the SWITCH
  estimator, which can use an existing reward model (not necessarily consistent) to
  achieve a better bias-variance tradeoff than IPS and DR. We prove an upper bound
  on its MSE and demonstrate its benefits empirically on a diverse collection of datasets,
  often outperforming prior work by orders of magnitude.
