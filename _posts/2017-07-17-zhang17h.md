abstract: Recent studies disclose that maximizing the minimum margin like support
  vector machines does not necessarily lead to better generalization performances,
  and instead, it is crucial to optimize the margin distribution. Although it has
  been shown that for binary classification, characterizing the margin distribution
  by the first- and second-order statistics can achieve superior performance. It still
  remains open for multi-class classification, and due to the complexity of margin
  for multi-class classification, optimizing its distribution by mean and variance
  can also be difficult. In this paper, we propose mcODM (multi-class Optimal margin
  Distribution Machine), which can solve this problem efficiently. We also give a
  theoretical analysis for our method, which verifies the significance of margin distribution
  for multi-class classification. Empirical study further shows that mcODM always
  outperforms all four versions of multi-class SVMs on all experimental data sets.
