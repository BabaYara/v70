abstract: 'This paper presents OptNet, a network architecture that integrates optimization
  problems (here, specifically in the form of quadratic programs) as individual layers
  in larger end-to-end trainable deep networks. These layers encode constraints and
  complex dependencies between the hidden states that traditional convolutional and
  fully-connected layers often cannot capture. In this paper, we explore the foundations
  for such an architecture: we show how techniques from sensitivity analysis, bilevel
  optimization, and implicit differentiation can be used to exactly differentiate
  through these layers and with respect to layer parameters; we develop a highly efficient
  solver for these layers that exploits fast GPU-based batch solves within a primal-dual
  interior point method, and which provides backpropagation gradients with virtually
  no additional cost on top of the solve; and we highlight the application of these
  approaches in several problems. In one notable example, we show that the method
  is capable of learning to play mini-Sudoku (4x4) given just input and output games,
  with no a priori information about the rules of the game; this highlights the ability
  of our architecture to learn hard constraints better than other neural architectures.'
