abstract: We introduce a new algorithm named WGAN, an alternative to traditional GAN
  training. In this new model, we show that we can improve the stability of learning,
  get rid of problems like mode collapse, and provide meaningful learning curves useful
  for debugging and hyperparameter searches. Furthermore, we show that the corresponding
  optimization problem is sound, and provide extensive theoretical work highlighting
  the deep connections to different distances between distributions.
