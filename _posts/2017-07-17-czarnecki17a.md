abstract: When training neural networks, the use of Synthetic Gradients (SG) allows
  layers or modules to be trained without update locking – without waiting for a true
  error gradient to be backpropagated – resulting in Decoupled Neural Interfaces (DNIs).
  This unlocked ability of being able to update parts of a neural network asynchronously
  and with only local information was demonstrated to work empirically in Jaderberg
  et al (2016). However, there has been very little demonstration of what changes
  DNIs and SGs impose from a functional, representational, and learning dynamics point
  of view. In this paper, we study DNIs through the use of synthetic gradients on
  feed-forward networks to better understand their behaviour and elucidate their effect
  on optimisation. We show that the incorporation of SGs does not affect the representational
  strength of the learning system for a neural network, and prove the convergence
  of the learning system for linear and deep linear models. On practical problems
  we investigate the mechanism by which synthetic gradient estimators approximate
  the true loss, and, surprisingly, how that leads to drastically different layer-wise
  representations. Finally, we also expose the relationship of using synthetic gradients
  to other error approximation techniques and find a unifying language for discussion
  and comparison.
