abstract: Probabilistic models analyze data by relying on a set of assumptions. Data
  that exhibit deviations from these assumptions can undermine inference and prediction
  quality. Robust models offer protection against mismatch between a modelâ€™s assumptions
  and reality. We propose a way to systematically detect and mitigate mismatch of
  a large class of probabilistic models. The idea is to raise the likelihood of each
  observation to a weight and then to infer both the latent variables and the weights
  from data. Inferring the weights allows a model to identify observations that match
  its assumptions and down-weight others. This enables robust inference and improves
  predictive accuracy. We study four different forms of mismatch with reality, ranging
  from missing latent groups to structure misspecification. A Poisson factorization
  analysis of the Movielens 1M dataset shows the benefits of this approach in a practical
  scenario.
