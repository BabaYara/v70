abstract: 'We initiate the study of fairness in reinforcement learning, where the
  actions of a learning algorithm may affect its environment and future rewards. Our
  fairness constraint requires that an algorithm never prefers one action over another
  if the long-term (discounted) reward of choosing the latter action is higher. Our
  first result is negative: despite the fact that fairness is consistent with the
  optimal policy, any learning algorithm satisfying fairness must take time exponential
  in the number of states to achieve non-trivial approximation to the optimal policy.
  We then provide a provably fair polynomial time algorithm under an approximate notion
  of fairness, thus establishing an exponential gap between exact and approximate
  fairness.'
