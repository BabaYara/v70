abstract: We reinterpret multiplicative noise in neural networks as auxiliary random
  variables that augment the approximate posterior in a variational setting for Bayesian
  neural networks. We show that through this interpretation it is both efficient and
  straightforward to improve the approximation by employing normalizing flows while
  still allowing for local reparametrizations and a tractable lower bound. In experiments
  we show that with this new approximation we can significantly improve upon classical
  mean field for Bayesian neural networks on both predictive accuracy as well as predictive
  uncertainty.
