abstract: This paper presents a new scalable approach, termed Innovation Pursuit (iPursuit),
  to the problem of subspace clustering. iPursuit rests on a new geometrical idea
  whereby each subspace is identified based on its novelty with respect to the other
  subspaces. The subspaces are identified consecutively by solving a series of simple
  linear optimization problems, each searching for a direction of innovation in the
  span of the data. A detailed mathematical analysis is provided establishing sufficient
  conditions for the proposed approach to correctly cluster the data points. Moreover,
  the proposed direction search approach can be integrated with spectral clustering
  to yield a new variant of spectral-clustering-based algorithms. Remarkably, the
  proposed approach can provably yield exact clustering even when the subspaces have
  significant intersections. The numerical simulations demonstrate that iPursuit can
  often outperform the state-of-the-art subspace clustering algorithms – more so for
  subspaces with significant intersections – along with substantial reductions in
  computational complexity.
