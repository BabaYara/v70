abstract: Many studies in biomedical and health sciences involve small sample sizes
  due to logistic or financial constraints. Often, identifying weak (but scientifically
  interesting) associations between a set of predictors and a response necessitates
  pooling datasets from multiple diverse labs or groups. While there is a rich literature
  in statistical machine learning to address distributional shifts and inference in
  multi-site datasets, it is less clear when such pooling is guaranteed to help (and
  when it does not) – independent of the inference algorithms we use. In this paper,
  we present a hypothesis test to answer this question, both for classical and high
  dimensional linear regression. We precisely identify regimes where pooling datasets
  across multiple sites is sensible, and how such policy decisions can be made via
  simple checks executable on each site before any data transfer ever happens. With
  a focus on Alzheimer’s disease studies, we present empirical results showing that
  in regimes suggested by our analysis, pooling a local dataset with data from an
  international study improves power.
