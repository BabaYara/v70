abstract: We propose an Online Learning with Local Permutations (OLLP) setting, in
  which the learner is allowed to slightly permute the <em>order</em> of the loss
  functions generated by an adversary. On one hand, this models natural situations
  where the exact order of the learnerâ€™s responses is not crucial, and on the other
  hand, might allow better learning and regret performance, by mitigating highly adversarial
  loss sequences. Also, with random permutations, this can be seen as a setting interpolating
  between adversarial and stochastic losses. In this paper, we consider the applicability
  of this setting to convex online learning with delayed feedback, in which the feedback
  on the prediction made in round $t$ arrives with some delay $\tau$. With such delayed
  feedback, the best possible regret bound is well-known to be $O(\sqrt{\tau T})$.
  We prove that by being able to permute losses by a distance of at most $M$ (for
  $M\geq \tau$), the regret can be improved to $O(\sqrt{T}(1+\sqrt{\tau^2/M}))$, using
  a Mirror-Descent based algorithm which can be applied for both Euclidean and non-Euclidean
  geometries. We also prove a lower bound, showing that for $M&lt;\tau/3$, it is impossible
  to improve the standard $O(\sqrt{\tau T})$ regret bound by more than constant factors.
  Finally, we provide some experiments validating the performance of our algorithm.
