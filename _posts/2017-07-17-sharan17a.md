abstract: The popular Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm for tensor decomposition
  is efficient and easy to implement, but often converges to poor local optima—particularly
  when the weights of the factors are non-uniform. We propose a modification of the
  ALS approach that is as efficient as standard ALS, but provably recovers the true
  factors with random initialization under standard incoherence assumptions on the
  factors of the tensor. We demonstrate the significant practical superiority of our
  approach over traditional ALS for a variety of tasks on synthetic data—including
  tensor factorization on exact, noisy and over-complete tensors, as well as tensor
  completion—and for computing word embeddings from a third-order word tri-occurrence
  tensor.
