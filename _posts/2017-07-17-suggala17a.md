abstract: Undirected graphical models or Markov random fields (MRFs) are widely used
  for modeling multivariate probability distributions. Much of the work on MRFs has
  focused on continuous variables, and nominal variables (that is, unordered categorical
  variables). However, data from many real world applications involve ordered categorical
  variables also known as ordinal variables, e.g., movie ratings on Netflix which
  can be ordered from 1 to 5 stars. With respect to univariate ordinal distributions,
  as we detail in the paper, there are two main categories of distributions; while
  there have been efforts to extend these to multivariate ordinal distributions, the
  resulting distributions are typically very complex, with either a large number of
  parameters, or with non-convex likelihoods. While there have been some work on tractable
  approximations, these do not come with strong statistical guarantees, and moreover
  are relatively computationally expensive. In this paper, we theoretically investigate
  two classes of graphical models for ordinal data, corresponding to the two main
  categories of univariate ordinal distributions. In contrast to previous work, our
  theoretical developments allow us to provide correspondingly two classes of estimators
  that are not only computationally efficient but also have strong statistical guarantees.
