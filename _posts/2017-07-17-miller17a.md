abstract: We propose a black-box variational inference method to approximate intractable
  distributions with an increasingly rich approximating class. Our method, variational
  boosting, iteratively refines an existing variational approximation by solving a
  sequence of optimization problems, allowing a trade-off between computation time
  and accuracy. We expand the variational approximating class by incorporating additional
  covariance structure and by introducing new components to form a mixture. We apply
  variational boosting to synthetic and real statistical models, and show that the
  resulting posterior inferences compare favorably to existing variational algorithms.
