abstract: We present an efficient second-order algorithm with $\tilde{O}(1/\eta \sqrt{T})$
  regret for the bandit online multiclass problem. The regret bound holds simultaneously
  with respect to a family of loss functions parameterized by $\eta$, ranging from
  hinge loss ($\eta=0$) to squared hinge loss ($\eta=1$). This provides a solution
  to the open problem of (Abernethy, J. and Rakhlin, A. An efficient bandit algorithm
  for $\sqrt{T}$-regret in online multiclass prediction? In COLT, 2009). We test our
  algorithm experimentally, showing that it performs favorably against earlier algorithms.
