abstract: 'We present Deep Voice, a production-quality text-to-speech system constructed
  entirely from deep neural networks. Deep Voice lays the groundwork for truly end-to-end
  neural speech synthesis. The system comprises five major building blocks: a segmentation
  model for locating phoneme boundaries, a grapheme-to-phoneme conversion model, a
  phoneme duration prediction model, a fundamental frequency prediction model, and
  an audio synthesis model. For the segmentation model, we propose a novel way of
  performing phoneme boundary detection with deep neural networks using connectionist
  temporal classification (CTC) loss. For the audio synthesis model, we implement
  a variant of WaveNet that requires fewer parameters and trains faster than the original.
  By using a neural network for each component, our system is simpler and more flexible
  than traditional text-to-speech systems, where each component requires laborious
  feature engineering and extensive domain expertise. Finally, we show that inference
  with our system can be performed faster than real time and describe optimized WaveNet
  inference kernels on both CPU and GPU that achieve up to 400x speedups over existing
  implementations.'
