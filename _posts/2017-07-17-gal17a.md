abstract: Even though active learning forms an important pillar of machine learning,
  deep learning tools are not prevalent within it. Deep learning poses several difficulties
  when used in an active learning setting. First, active learning (AL) methods generally
  rely on being able to learn and update models from small amounts of data. Recent
  advances in deep learning, on the other hand, are notorious for their dependence
  on large amounts of data. Second, many AL acquisition functions rely on model uncertainty,
  yet deep learning methods rarely represent such model uncertainty. In this paper
  we combine recent advances in Bayesian deep learning into the active learning framework
  in a practical way. We develop an active learning framework for high dimensional
  data, a task which has been extremely challenging so far, with very sparse existing
  literature. Taking advantage of specialised models such as Bayesian convolutional
  neural networks, we demonstrate our active learning techniques with image data,
  obtaining a significant improvement on existing active learning approaches. We demonstrate
  this on both the MNIST dataset, as well as for skin cancer diagnosis from lesion
  images (ISIC2016 task).
