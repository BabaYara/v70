abstract: 'Clustering is the task of grouping a set of examples so that similar examples
  are grouped into the same cluster while dissimilar examples are in different clusters.
  The quality of a clustering depends on two problem-dependent factors which are i)
  the chosen similarity metric and ii) the data representation. Supervised clustering
  approaches, which exploit labeled partitioned datasets have thus been proposed,
  for instance to learn a metric optimized to perform clustering. However, most of
  these approaches assume that the representation of the data is fixed and then learn
  an appropriate linear transformation. Some deep supervised clustering learning approaches
  have also been proposed. However, they rely on iterative methods to compute gradients
  resulting in high algorithmic complexity. In this paper, we propose a deep supervised
  clustering metric learning method that formulates a novel loss function. We derive
  a closed-form expression for the gradient that is efficient to compute: the complexity
  to compute the gradient is linear in the size of the training mini-batch and quadratic
  in the representation dimensionality. We further reveal how our approach can be
  seen as learning spectral clustering. Experiments on standard real-world datasets
  confirm state-of-the-art Recall@K performance.'
