abstract: We consider the stochastic bandit problem with a continuous set of arms,
  with the expected reward function over the arms assumed to be fixed but unknown.
  We provide two new Gaussian process-based algorithms for continuous bandit optimization
  â€“ Improved GP-UCB (IGP-UCB) and GP-Thomson sampling (GP-TS), and derive corresponding
  regret bounds. Specifically, the bounds hold when the expected reward function belongs
  to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that naturally corresponds to a Gaussian
  process kernel used as input by the algorithms. Along the way, we derive a new self-normalized
  concentration inequality for vector-valued martingales of arbitrary, possibly infinite,
  dimension. Finally, experimental evaluation and comparisons to existing algorithms
  on synthetic and real-world environments are carried out that highlight the favourable
  gains of the proposed strategies in many cases.
