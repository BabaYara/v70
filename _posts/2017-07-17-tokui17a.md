abstract: The likelihood-ratio method is often used to estimate gradients of stochastic
  computations, for which baselines are required to reduce the estimation variance.
  Many types of baselines have been proposed, although their degree of optimality
  is not well understood. In this study, we establish a novel framework of gradient
  estimation that includes most of the common gradient estimators as special cases.
  The framework gives a natural derivation of the optimal estimator that can be interpreted
  as a special case of the likelihood-ratio method so that we can evaluate the optimal
  degree of practical techniques with it. It bridges the likelihood-ratio method and
  the reparameterization trick while still supporting discrete variables. It is derived
  from the exchange property of the differentiation and integration. To be more specific,
  it is derived by the reparameterization trick and local marginalization analogous
  to the local expectation gradient. We evaluate various baselines and the optimal
  estimator for variational learning and show that the performance of the modern estimators
  is close to the optimal estimator.
