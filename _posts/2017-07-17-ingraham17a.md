abstract: Undirected graphical models are applied in genomics, protein structure prediction,
  and neuroscience to identify sparse interactions that underlie discrete data. Although
  Bayesian methods for inference would be favorable in these contexts, they are rarely
  used because they require doubly intractable Monte Carlo sampling. Here, we develop
  a framework for scalable Bayesian inference of discrete undirected models based
  on two new methods. The first is Persistent VI, an algorithm for variational inference
  of discrete undirected models that avoids doubly intractable MCMC and approximations
  of the partition function. The second is Fadeout, a reparameterization approach
  for variational inference under sparsity-inducing priors that captures a posteriori
  correlations between parameters and hyperparameters with noncentered parameterizations.
  We find that, together, these methods for variational inference substantially improve
  learning of sparse undirected graphical models in simulated and real problems from
  physics and biology.
