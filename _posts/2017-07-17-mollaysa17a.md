abstract: Very often features come with their own vectorial descriptions which provide
  detailed information about their properties. We refer to these vectorial descriptions
  as feature side-information. In the standard learning scenario, input is represented
  as a vector of features and the feature side-information is most often ignored or
  used only for feature selection prior to model fitting. We believe that feature
  side-information which carries information about features intrinsic property will
  help improve model prediction if used in a proper way during learning process. In
  this paper, we propose a framework that allows for the incorporation of the feature
  side-information during the learning of very general model families to improve the
  prediction performance. We control the structures of the learned models so that
  they reflect featuresâ€™ similarities as these are defined on the basis of the side-information.
  We perform experiments on a number of benchmark datasets which show significant
  predictive performance gains, over a number of baselines, as a result of the exploitation
  of the side-information.
