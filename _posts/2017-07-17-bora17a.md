abstract: 'The goal of compressed sensing is to estimate a vector from an underdetermined
  system of noisy linear measurements, by making use of prior knowledge on the structure
  of vectors in the relevant domain. For almost all results in this literature, the
  structure is represented by sparsity in a well-chosen basis. We show how to achieve
  guarantees similar to standard compressed sensing but without employing sparsity
  at all. Instead, we suppose that vectors lie near the range of a generative model
  $G: \mathbbR^k \to \mathbbR^n$. Our main theorem is that, if $G$ is $L$-Lipschitz,
  then roughly $\mathcalO(k \log L)$ random Gaussian measurements suffice for an $\ell_2/\ell_2$
  recovery guarantee. We demonstrate our results using generative models from published
  variational autoencoder and generative adversarial networks. Our method can use
  $5$-$10$x fewer measurements than Lasso for the same accuracy.'
