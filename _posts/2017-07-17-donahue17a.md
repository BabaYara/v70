abstract: 'Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) is a popular rhythm-based video game. Players
  perform steps on a dance platform in synchronization with music as directed by on-screen
  step charts. While many step charts are available in standardized packs, players
  may grow tired of existing charts, or wish to dance to a song for which no chart
  exists. We introduce the task of learning to choreograph. Given a raw audio track,
  the goal is to produce a new step chart. This task decomposes naturally into two
  subtasks: deciding when to place steps and deciding which steps to select. For the
  step placement task, we combine recurrent and convolutional neural networks to ingest
  spectrograms of low-level audio features to predict steps, conditioned on chart
  difficulty. For step selection, we present a conditional LSTM generative model that
  substantially outperforms n-gram and fixed-window approaches.'
