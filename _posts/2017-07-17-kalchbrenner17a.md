abstract: We propose a probabilistic video model, the Video Pixel Network (VPN), that
  estimates the discrete joint distribution of the raw pixel values in a video. The
  model and the neural architecture reflect the time, space and color structure of
  video tensors and encode it as a four-dimensional dependency chain. The VPN approaches
  the best possible performance on the Moving MNIST benchmark, a leap over the previous
  state of the art, and the generated videos show only minor deviations from the ground
  truth. The VPN also produces detailed samples on the action-conditional Robotic
  Pushing benchmark and generalizes to the motion of novel objects.
