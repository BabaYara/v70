abstract: Probability distributions produced by the cross-entropy loss for ordinal
  classification problems can possess undesired properties. We propose a straightforward
  technique to constrain discrete ordinal probability distributions to be unimodal
  via the use of the Poisson and binomial probability distributions. We evaluate this
  approach in the context of deep learning on two large ordinal image datasets, obtaining
  promising results.
