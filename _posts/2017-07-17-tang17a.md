abstract: We propose a randomized first order optimization algorithm Gradient Projection
  Iterative Sketch (GPIS) and an accelerated variant for efficiently solving large
  scale constrained Least Squares (LS). We provide the first theoretical convergence
  analysis for both algorithms. An efficient implementation using a tailored line-search
  scheme is also proposed. We demonstrate our methodsâ€™ computational efficiency compared
  to the classical accelerated gradient method, and the variance-reduced stochastic
  gradient methods through numerical experiments in various large synthetic/real data
  sets.
