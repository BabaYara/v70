abstract: We propose to study equivariance in deep neural networks through parameter
  symmetries. In particular, given a group G that acts discretely on the input and
  output of a standard neural network layer, we show that its equivariance is linked
  to the symmetry group of network parameters. We then propose two parameter-sharing
  scheme to induce the desirable symmetry on the parameters of the neural network.
  Under some conditions on the action of G, our procedure for tying the parameters
  achieves G-equivariance and guarantees sensitivity to all other permutation groups
  outside of G.
