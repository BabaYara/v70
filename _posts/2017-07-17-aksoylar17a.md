abstract: We propose a novel, computationally efficient mirror-descent based optimization
  framework for subgraph detection in graph-structured data. Our aim is to discover
  anomalous patterns present in a connected subgraph of a given graph. This problem
  arises in many applications such as detection of network intrusions, community detection,
  detection of anomalous events in surveillance videos or disease outbreaks. Since
  optimization over connected subgraphs is a combinatorial and computationally difficult
  problem, we propose a convex relaxation that offers a principled approach to incorporating
  connectivity and conductance constraints on candidate subgraphs. We develop a novel
  efficient algorithm to solve the relaxed problem, establish convergence guarantees
  and demonstrate its feasibility and performance with experiments on real and very
  large simulated networks.
