abstract: Estimating covariance matrices is a fundamental technique in various domains,
  most notably in machine learning and signal processing. To tackle the challenges
  of extensive communication costs, large storage capacity requirements, and high
  processing time complexity when handling massive high-dimensional and distributed
  data, we propose an efficient and accurate covariance matrix estimation method via
  data compression. In contrast to previous data-oblivious compression schemes, we
  leverage a data-aware weighted sampling method to construct low-dimensional data
  for such estimation. We rigorously prove that our proposed estimator is unbiased
  and requires smaller data to achieve the same accuracy with specially designed sampling
  distributions. Besides, we depict that the computational procedures in our algorithm
  are efficient. All achievements imply an improved tradeoff between the estimation
  accuracy and computational costs. Finally, the extensive experiments on synthetic
  and real-world datasets validate the superior property of our method and illustrate
  that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.
