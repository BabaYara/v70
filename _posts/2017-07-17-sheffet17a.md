abstract: Linear regression is one of the most prevalent techniques in machine learning;
  however, it is also common to use linear regression for its explanatory capabilities
  rather than label prediction. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is often used in statistics
  to establish a correlation between an attribute (e.g. gender) and a label (e.g.
  income) in the presence of other (potentially correlated) features. OLS assumes
  a particular model that randomly generates the data, and derives t-values — representing
  the likelihood of each real value to be the true correlation. Using t-values, OLS
  can release a confidence interval, which is an interval on the reals that is likely
  to contain the true correlation; and when this interval does not intersect the origin,
  we can reject the null hypothesis as it is likely that the true correlation is non-zero.
  Our work aims at achieving similar guarantees on data under differentially private
  estimators. First, we show that for well-spread data, the Gaussian Johnson-Lindenstrauss
  Transform (JLT) gives a very good approximation of t-values; secondly, when JLT
  approximates Ridge regression (linear regression with $l_2$-regularization) we derive,
  under certain conditions, confidence intervals using the projected data; lastly,
  we derive, under different conditions, confidence intervals for the “Analyze Gauss”
  algorithm (Dwork et al 2014).
