abstract: We develop differentially private hypothesis testing methods for the small
  sample regime. Given a sample $\mathcalD$ from a categorical distribution $p$ over
  some domain $Σ$, an explicitly described distribution $q$ over $Σ$, some privacy
  parameter $ε$, accuracy parameter $α$, and requirements $\beta_\mathrmI$ and $\beta_\mathrmII$
  for the type I and type II errors of our test, the goal is to distinguish between
  $p=q$ and $d_\mathrmtv(p,q) \ge α$. We provide theoretical bounds for the sample
  size $|\mathcalD|$ so that our method both satisfies $(ε,0)$-differential privacy,
  and guarantees $\beta_\mathrmI$ and $\beta_\mathrmII$ type I and type II errors.
  We show that differential privacy may come for free in some regimes of parameters,
  and we always beat the sample complexity resulting from running the $χ^2$-test with
  noisy counts, or standard approaches such as repetition for endowing non-private
  $χ^2$-style statistics with differential privacy guarantees. We experimentally compare
  the sample complexity of our method to that of recently proposed methods for private
  hypothesis testing.
