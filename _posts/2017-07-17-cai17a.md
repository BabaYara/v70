abstract: We develop differentially private hypothesis testing methods for the small
  sample regime. Given a sample $\mathcal{D}$ from a categorical distribution $p$
  over some domain $\Sigma$, an explicitly described distribution $q$ over $\Sigma$,
  some privacy parameter $\epsilon$, accuracy parameter $\alpha$, and requirements
  $\beta_\mathrm{I}$ and $\beta_\mathrm{II}$ for the type I and type II errors of
  our test, the goal is to distinguish between $p=q$ and $d_\mathrm{tv}(p,q) \ge \alpha$.
  We provide theoretical bounds for the sample size $|\mathcal{D}|$ so that our method
  both satisfies $(\epsilon,0)$-differential privacy, and guarantees $\beta_\mathrm{I}$
  and $\beta_\mathrm{II}$ type I and type II errors. We show that differential privacy
  may come for free in some regimes of parameters, and we always beat the sample complexity
  resulting from running the $\chi^2$-test with noisy counts, or standard approaches
  such as repetition for endowing non-private $\chi^2$-style statistics with differential
  privacy guarantees. We experimentally compare the sample complexity of our method
  to that of recently proposed methods for private hypothesis testing.
