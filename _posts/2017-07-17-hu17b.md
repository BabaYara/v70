abstract: Learning discrete representations of data is a central machine learning
  task because of the compactness of the representations and ease of interpretation.
  The task includes clustering and hash learning as special cases. Deep neural networks
  are promising to be used because they can model the non-linearity of data and scale
  to large datasets. However, their model complexity is huge, and therefore, we need
  to carefully regularize the networks in order to learn useful representations that
  exhibit intended invariance for applications of interest. To this end, we propose
  a method called Information Maximizing Self-Augmented Training (IMSAT). In IMSAT,
  we use data augmentation to impose the invariance on discrete representations. More
  specifically, we encourage the predicted representations of augmented data points
  to be close to those of the original data points in an end-to-end fashion. At the
  same time, we maximize the information-theoretic dependency between data and their
  predicted discrete representations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
  show that IMSAT produces state-of-the-art results for both clustering and unsupervised
  hash learning.
