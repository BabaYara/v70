abstract: Online sparse linear regression is an online problem where an algorithm
  repeatedly chooses a subset of coordinates to observe in an adversarially chosen
  feature vector, makes a real-valued prediction, receives the true label, and incurs
  the squared loss. The goal is to design an online learning algorithm with sublinear
  regret to the best sparse linear predictor in hindsight. Without any assumptions,
  this problem is known to be computationally intractable. In this paper, we make
  the assumption that data matrix satisfies restricted isometry property, and show
  that this assumption leads to computationally efficient algorithms with sublinear
  regret for two variants of the problem. In the first variant, the true label is
  generated according to a sparse linear model with additive Gaussian noise. In the
  second, the true label is chosen adversarially.
