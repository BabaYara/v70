abstract: Semidefinite relaxation methods transform a variety of non-convex optimization
  problems into convex problems, but square the number of variables. We study a new
  type of convex relaxation for phase retrieval problems, called PhaseMax, that convexifies
  the underlying problem without lifting. The resulting problem formulation can be
  solved using standard convex optimization routines, while still working in the original,
  low-dimensional variable space. We prove, using a random spherical distribution
  measurement model, that PhaseMax succeeds with high probability for a sufficiently
  large number of measurements. We compare our approach to other phase retrieval methods
  and demonstrate that our theory accurately predicts the success of PhaseMax.
