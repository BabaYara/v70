abstract: Hierarchical Bayesian models often capture distributions over a very large
  number of distinct atoms. The need for these models arises when organizing huge
  amount of unsupervised data, for instance, features extracted using deep convnets
  that can be exploited to organize abundant unlabeled images. Inference for hierarchical
  Bayesian models in such cases can be rather nontrivial, leading to approximate approaches.
  In this work, we propose <em>Canopy</em>, a sampler based on Cover Trees that is
  exact, has guaranteed runtime logarithmic in the number of atoms, and is provably
  polynomial in the inherent dimensionality of the underlying parameter space. In
  other words, the algorithm is as fast as search over a hierarchical data structure.
  We provide theory for Canopy and demonstrate its effectiveness on both synthetic
  and real datasets, consisting of over 100 million images.
