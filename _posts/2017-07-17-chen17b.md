abstract: We study the problem of selecting K arms with the highest expected rewards
  in a stochastic n-armed bandit game. This problem has a wide range of applications,
  e.g., A/B testing, crowdsourcing, simulation optimization. Our goal is to develop
  a PAC algorithm, which, with probability at least $1-δ$, identifies a set of K arms
  with the aggregate regret at most $ε$. The notion of aggregate regret for multiple-arm
  identification was first introduced in Zhou et. al. (2014), which is defined as
  the difference of the averaged expected rewards between the selected set of arms
  and the best K arms. In contrast to Zhou et. al. (2014) that only provides instance-independent
  sample complexity, we introduce a new hardness parameter for characterizing the
  difficulty of any given instance. We further develop two algorithms and establish
  the corresponding sample complexity in terms of this hardness parameter. The derived
  sample complexity can be significantly smaller than state-of-the-art results for
  a large class of instances and matches the instance-independent lower bound up to
  a $\log(ε^-1)$ factor in the worst case. We also prove a lower bound result showing
  that the extra $\log(ε^-1)$ is necessary for instance-dependent algorithms using
  the introduced hardness parameter.
