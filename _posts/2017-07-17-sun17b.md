abstract: Fisher information and natural gradient provided deep insights and powerful
  tools to artificial neural networks. However related analysis becomes more and more
  difficult as the learnerâ€™s structure turns large and complex. This paper makes a
  preliminary step towards a new direction. We extract a local component from a large
  neural system, and define its relative Fisher information metric that describes
  accurately this small component, and is invariant to the other parts of the system.
  This concept is important because the geometry structure is much simplified and
  it can be easily applied to guide the learning of neural networks. We provide an
  analysis on a list of commonly used components, and demonstrate how to use this
  concept to further improve optimization.
