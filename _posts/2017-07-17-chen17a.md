abstract: In this paper, we investigate general single-index models (SIMs) in high
  dimensions. Based on U-statistics, we propose two types of robust estimators for
  the recovery of model parameters, which can be viewed as generalizations of several
  existing algorithms for one-bit compressed sensing (1-bit CS). With minimal assumption
  on noise, the statistical guarantees are established for the generalized estimators
  under suitable conditions, which allow general structures of underlying parameter.
  Moreover, the proposed estimator is novelly instantiated for SIMs with monotone
  transfer function, and the obtained estimator can better leverage the monotonicity.
  Experimental results are provided to support our theoretical analyses.
