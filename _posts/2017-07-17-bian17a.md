abstract: We investigate the performance of the standard Greedy algorithm for cardinality
  constrained maximization of non-submodular nondecreasing set functions. While there
  are strong theoretical guarantees on the performance of Greedy for maximizing submodular
  functions, there are few guarantees for non-submodular ones. However, Greedy enjoys
  strong empirical performance for many important non-submodular functions, e.g.,
  the Bayesian A-optimality objective in experimental design. We prove theoretical
  guarantees supporting the empirical performance. Our guarantees are characterized
  by a combination of the (generalized) curvature $\alpha$ and the submodularity ratio
  $\gamma$. In particular, we prove that Greedy enjoys a tight approximation guarantee
  of $\frac{1}{\alpha}(1- e^{-\gamma\alpha})$ for cardinality constrained maximization.
  In addition, we bound the submodularity ratio and curvature for several important
  real-world objectives, including the Bayesian A-optimality objective, the determinantal
  function of a square submatrix and certain linear programs with combinatorial constraints.
  We experimentally validate our theoretical findings for both synthetic and real-world
  applications.
