abstract: We explore the sequential decision making problem where the goal is to estimate
  uniformly well a number of linear models, given a shared budget of random contexts
  independently sampled from a known distribution. The decision maker must query one
  of the linear models for each incoming context, and receives an observation corrupted
  by noise levels that are unknown, and depend on the model instance. We present Trace-UCB,
  an adaptive allocation algorithm that learns the noise levels while balancing contexts
  accordingly across the different linear functions, and derive guarantees for simple
  regret in both expectation and high-probability. Finally, we extend the algorithm
  and its guarantees to high dimensional settings, where the number of linear models
  times the dimension of the contextual space is higher than the total budget of samples.
  Simulations with real data suggest that Trace-UCB is remarkably robust, outperforming
  a number of baselines even when its assumptions are violated.
