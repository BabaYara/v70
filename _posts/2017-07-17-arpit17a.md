abstract: We examine the role of memorization in deep learning, drawing connections
  to capacity, generalization, and adversarial robustness. While deep networks are
  capable of memorizing noise data, our results suggest that they tend to prioritize
  learning simple patterns first. In our experiments, we expose qualitative differences
  in gradient-based optimization of deep neural networks (DNNs) on noise vs.~real
  data. We also demonstrate that for appropriately tuned explicit regularization (e.g.,~dropout)
  we can degrade DNN training performance on noise datasets without compromising generalization
  on real data. Our analysis suggests that the notions of effective capacity which
  are dataset independent are unlikely to explain the generalization performance of
  deep networks when trained with gradient based methods because training data itself
  plays an important role in determining the degree of memorization.
