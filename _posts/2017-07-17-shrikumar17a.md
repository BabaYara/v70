abstract: 'The purported “black box” nature of neural networks is a barrier to adoption
  in applications where interpretability is essential. Here we present DeepLIFT (Deep
  Learning Important FeaTures), a method for decomposing the output prediction of
  a neural network on a specific input by backpropagating the contributions of all
  neurons in the network to every feature of the input. DeepLIFT compares the activation
  of each neuron to its ‘reference activation’ and assigns contribution scores according
  to the difference. By optionally giving separate consideration to positive and negative
  contributions, DeepLIFT can also reveal dependencies which are missed by other approaches.
  Scores can be computed efficiently in a single backward pass. We apply DeepLIFT
  to models trained on MNIST and simulated genomic data, and show significant advantages
  over gradient-based methods. Video tutorial: http://goo.gl/qKb7pL code: http://goo.gl/RM8jvH'
