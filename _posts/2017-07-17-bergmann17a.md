abstract: 'This paper introduces a novel approach to texture synthesis based on generative
  adversarial networks (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014), and call this technique Periodic
  Spatial GAN (PSGAN). The PSGAN has several novel abilities which surpass the current
  state of the art in texture synthesis. First, we can learn multiple textures, periodic
  or non-periodic, from datasets of one or more complex large images. Second, we show
  that the image generation with PSGANs has properties of a texture manifold: we can
  smoothly interpolate between samples in the structured noise space and generate
  novel samples, which lie perceptually between the textures of the original dataset.
  We make multiple experiments which show that PSGANs can flexibly handle diverse
  texture and image data sources, and the method is highly scalable and can generate
  output images of arbitrary large size.'
