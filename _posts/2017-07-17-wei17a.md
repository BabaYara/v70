abstract: A key challenge in multi-source transfer learning is to capture the diverse
  inter-domain similarities. In this paper, we study different approaches based on
  Gaussian process models to solve the multi-source transfer regression problem. Precisely,
  we first investigate the feasibility and performance of a family of transfer covariance
  functions that represent the pairwise similarity of each source and the target domain.
  We theoretically show that using such a transfer covariance function for general
  Gaussian process modelling can only capture the same similarity coefficient for
  all the sources, and thus may result in unsatisfactory transfer performance. This
  leads us to propose <em>TC$_{MS}$Stack</em>, an integrated strategy incorporating
  the benefits of the transfer covariance function and stacking. Extensive experiments
  on one synthetic and two real-world datasets, with learning settings of up to 11
  sources for the latter, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed <em>TC$_{MS}$Stack</em>.
