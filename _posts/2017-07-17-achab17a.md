abstract: We design a new nonparametric method that allows one to estimate the matrix
  of integrated kernels of a multivariate Hawkes process. This matrix not only encodes
  the mutual influences of each node of the process, but also disentangles the causality
  relationships between them. Our approach is the first that leads to an estimation
  of this matrix <em>without any parametric modeling and estimation of the kernels
  themselves</em>. A consequence is that it can give an estimation of causality relationships
  between nodes (or users), based on their activity timestamps (on a social network
  for instance), without knowing or estimating the shape of the activities lifetime.
  For that purpose, we introduce a moment matching method that fits the second-order
  and the third-order integrated cumulants of the process. A theoretical analysis
  allows to prove that this new estimation technique is consistent. Moreover, we show
  on numerical experiments that our approach is indeed very robust to the shape of
  the kernels, and gives appealing results on the MemeTracker database and on financial
  order book data.
