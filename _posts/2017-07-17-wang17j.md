abstract: Segmental structure is a common pattern in many types of sequences such
  as phrases in human languages. In this paper, we present a probabilistic model for
  sequences via their segmentations. The probability of a segmented sequence is calculated
  as the product of the probabilities of all its segments, where each segment is modeled
  using existing tools such as recurrent neural networks. Since the segmentation of
  a sequence is usually unknown in advance, we sum over all valid segmentations to
  obtain the final probability for the sequence. An efficient dynamic programming
  algorithm is developed for forward and backward computations without resorting to
  any approximation. We demonstrate our approach on text segmentation and speech recognition
  tasks. In addition to quantitative results, we also show that our approach can discover
  meaningful segments in their respective application contexts.
