abstract: Large-scale multi-relational embedding refers to the task of learning the
  latent representations for entities and relations in large knowledge graphs. An
  effective and scalable solution for this problem is crucial for the true success
  of knowledge-based inference in a broad range of applications. This paper proposes
  a novel framework for optimizing the latent representations with respect to the
  \emphanalogical properties of the embedded entities and relations. By formulating
  the objective function in a differentiable fashion, our model enjoys both its theoretical
  power and computational scalability, and significantly outperformed a large number
  of representative baseline methods on benchmark datasets. Furthermore, the model
  offers an elegant unification of several well-known methods in multi-relational
  embedding, which can be proven to be special instantiations of our framework.
