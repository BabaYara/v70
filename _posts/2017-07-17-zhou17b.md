abstract: We study the problem on how to learn the pure Nash Equilibrium of a two-player
  zero-sum static game with random payoffs under unknown distributions via efficient
  payoff queries. We introduce a multi-armed bandit model to this problem due to its
  ability to find the best arm efficiently among random arms and propose two algorithms
  for this problemâ€”LUCB-G based on the confidence bounds and a racing algorithm based
  on successive action elimination. We provide an analysis on the sample complexity
  lower bound when the Nash Equilibrium exists.
