abstract: We study the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function subject
  to a cardinality constraint $k$, with the added twist that a number of items $τ$
  from the returned set may be removed. We focus on the worst-case setting considered
  by Orlin et al. (2016), in which a constant-factor approximation guarantee was given
  for $τ= o(\sqrtk)$. In this paper, we solve a key open problem raised therein, presenting
  a new Partitioned Robust (PRo) submodular maximization algorithm that achieves the
  same guarantee for more general $τ= o(k)$. Our algorithm constructs partitions consisting
  of buckets with exponentially increasing sizes, and applies standard submodular
  optimization subroutines on the buckets in order to construct the robust solution.
  We numerically demonstrate the performance of PRo in data summarization and influence
  maximization, demonstrating gains over both the greedy algorithm and the algorithm
  of Orlin et al. (2016).
