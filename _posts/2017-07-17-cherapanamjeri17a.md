abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of Robust Matrix Completion (RMC)
  where the goal is to recover a low-rank matrix by observing a small number of its
  entries out of which a few can be arbitrarily corrupted. We propose a simple projected
  gradient descent-based method to estimate the low-rank matrix that alternately performs
  a projected gradient descent step and cleans up a few of the corrupted entries using
  hard-thresholding. Our algorithm solves RMC using nearly optimal number of observations
  while tolerating a nearly optimal number of corruptions. Our result also implies
  significant improvement over the existing time complexity bounds for the low-rank
  matrix completion problem. Finally, an application of our result to the robust PCA
  problem (low-rank+sparse matrix separation) leads to nearly linear time (in matrix
  dimensions) algorithm for the same; existing state-of-the-art methods require quadratic
  time. Our empirical results corroborate our theoretical results and show that even
  for moderate sized problems, our method for robust PCA is an order of magnitude
  faster than the existing methods.
