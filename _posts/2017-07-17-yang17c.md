abstract: The cardinality constraint is an intrinsic way to restrict the solution
  structure in many domains, for example, sparse learning, feature selection, and
  compressed sensing. To solve a cardinality constrained problem, the key challenge
  is to solve the projection onto the cardinality constraint set, which is NP-hard
  in general when there exist multiple overlapped cardinality constraints. In this
  paper, we consider the scenario where the overlapped cardinality constraints satisfy
  a Three-view Cardinality Structure (TVCS), which reflects the natural restriction
  in many applications, such as identification of gene regulatory networks and task-worker
  assignment problem. We cast the projection into a linear programming, and show that
  for TVCS, the vertex solution of this linear programming is the solution for the
  original projection problem. We further prove that such solution can be found with
  the complexity proportional to the number of variables and constraints. We finally
  use synthetic experiments and two interesting applications in bioinformatics and
  crowdsourcing to validate the proposed TVCS model and method.
