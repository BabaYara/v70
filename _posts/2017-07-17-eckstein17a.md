abstract: We describe a learning procedure enhancing L1-penalized regression by adding
  dynamically generated rules describing multidimensional “box” sets. Our rule-adding
  procedure is based on the classical column generation method for high-dimensional
  linear programming. The pricing problem for our column generation procedure reduces
  to the NP-hard rectangular maximum agreement (RMA) problem of finding a box that
  best discriminates between two weighted datasets. We solve this problem exactly
  using a parallel branch-and-bound procedure. The resulting rule-enhanced regression
  procedure is computation-intensive, but has promising prediction performance.
