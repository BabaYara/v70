abstract: 'In this paper, we consider optimizing submodular functions that are drawn
  from some unknown distribution. This setting arises, e.g., in recommender systems,
  where the utility of a subset of items may depend on a user-specific submodular
  utility function. In modern applications, the ground set of items is often so large
  that even the widely used (lazy) greedy algorithm is not efficient enough. As a
  remedy, we introduce the problem of sublinear time probabilistic submodular maximization:
  Given training examples of functions (e.g., via user feature vectors), we seek to
  reduce the ground set so that optimizing new functions drawn from the same distribution
  will provide almost as much value when restricted to the reduced ground set as when
  using the full set. We cast this problem as a two-stage submodular maximization
  and develop a novel efficient algorithm for this problem which offers $1/2(1 - 1/e^2)$
  approximation ratio for general monotone submodular functions and general matroid
  constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several real-world
  applications where running the maximization problem on the reduced ground set leads
  to two orders of magnitude speed-up while incurring almost no loss.'
