abstract: 'Recent work on generative text modeling has found that variational autoencoders
  (VAE) with LSTM decoders perform worse than simpler LSTM language models (Bowman
  et al., 2015). This negative result is so far poorly understood, but has been attributed
  to the propensity of LSTM decoders to ignore conditioning information from the encoder.
  In this paper, we experiment with a new type of decoder for VAE: a dilated CNN.
  By changing the decoderâ€™s dilation architecture, we control the size of context
  from previously generated words. In experiments, we find that there is a trade-off
  between contextual capacity of the decoder and effective use of encoding information.
  We show that when carefully managed, VAEs can outperform LSTM language models. We
  demonstrate perplexity gains on two datasets, representing the first positive language
  modeling result with VAE. Further, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the use
  of VAE (with our new decoding architecture) for semi-supervised and unsupervised
  labeling tasks, demonstrating gains over several strong baselines.'
