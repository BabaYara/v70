abstract: The large model capacity of latent space models (LSMs) enables them to achieve
  great performance on various applications, but meanwhile renders LSMs to be prone
  to overfitting. Several recent studies investigate a new type of regularization
  approach, which encourages components in LSMs to be diverse, for the sake of alleviating
  overfitting. While they have shown promising empirical effectiveness, in theory
  why larger “diversity” results in less overfitting is still unclear. To bridge this
  gap, we propose a new diversity-promoting approach that is both theoretically analyzable
  and empirically effective. Specifically, we use near-orthogonality to characterize
  “diversity” and impose angular constraints (ACs) on the components of LSMs to promote
  diversity. A generalization error analysis shows that larger diversity results in
  smaller estimation error and larger approximation error. An efficient ADMM algorithm
  is developed to solve the constrained LSM problems. Experiments demonstrate that
  ACs improve generalization performance of LSMs and outperform other diversity-promoting
  approaches.
