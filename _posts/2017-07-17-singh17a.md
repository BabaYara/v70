abstract: 'We study the problem of using i.i.d. samples from an unknown multivariate
  probability distribution p to estimate the mutual information of p. This problem
  has recently received attention in two settings: (1) where p is assumed to be Gaussian
  and (2) where p is assumed only to lie in a large nonparametric smoothness class.
  Estimators proposed for the Gaussian case converge in high dimensions when the Gaussian
  assumption holds, but are brittle, failing dramatically when p is not Gaussian,
  while estimators proposed for the nonparametric case fail to converge with realistic
  sample sizes except in very low dimension. Hence, there is a lack of robust mutual
  information estimators for many realistic data. To address this, we propose estimators
  for mutual information when p is assumed to be a nonparanormal (or Gaussian copula)
  model, a semiparametric compromise between Gaussian and nonparametric extremes.
  Using theoretical bounds and experiments, we show these estimators strike a practical
  balance between robustness and scalability.'
