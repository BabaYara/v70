abstract: 'In this paper, we present a stochastic version of DCA (Difference of Convex
  functions Algorithm) to solve a class of optimization problems whose objective function
  is a large sum of non-convex functions and a regularization term. We consider the
  $\ell_{2,0}$ regularization to deal with the group variables selection. By exploiting
  the special structure of the problem, we propose an efficient DC decomposition for
  which the corresponding stochastic DCA scheme is very inexpensive: it only requires
  the projection of points onto balls that is explicitly computed. As an application,
  we applied our algorithm for the group variables selection in multiclass logistic
  regression. Numerical experiments on several benchmark datasets and synthetic datasets
  illustrate the efficiency of our algorithm and its superiority over well-known methods,
  with respect to classification accuracy, sparsity of solution as well as running
  time.'
