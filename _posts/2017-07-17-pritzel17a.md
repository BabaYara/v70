abstract: 'Deep reinforcement learning methods attain super-human performance in a
  wide range of environments. Such methods are grossly inefficient, often taking orders
  of magnitudes more data than humans to achieve reasonable performance. We propose
  Neural Episodic Control: a deep reinforcement learning agent that is able to rapidly
  assimilate new experiences and act upon them. Our agent uses a semi-tabular representation
  of the value function: a buffer of past experience containing slowly changing state
  representations and rapidly updated estimates of the value function. We show across
  a wide range of environments that our agent learns significantly faster than other
  state-of-the-art, general purpose deep reinforcement learning agents.'
