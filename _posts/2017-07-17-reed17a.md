abstract: PixelCNN achieves state-of-the-art results in density estimation for natural
  images. Although training is fast, inference is costly, requiring one network evaluation
  per pixel; O(N) for N pixels. This can be sped up by caching activations, but still
  involves generating each pixel sequentially. In this work, we propose a parallelized
  PixelCNN that allows more efficient inference by modeling certain pixel groups as
  conditionally independent. Our new PixelCNN model achieves competitive density estimation
  and orders of magnitude speedup – O(log N) sampling instead of O(N) – enabling the
  practical generation of 512x512 images. We evaluate the model on class-conditional
  image generation, text-to-image synthesis, and action-conditional video generation,
  showing that our model achieves the best results among non-pixel-autoregressive
  density models that allow efficient sampling.
