abstract: Generic generation and manipulation of text is challenging and has limited
  success compared to recent deep generative modeling in visual domain. This paper
  aims at generating plausible text sentences, whose attributes are controlled by
  learning disentangled latent representations with designated semantics. We propose
  a new neural generative model which combines variational auto-encoders (VAEs) and
  holistic attribute discriminators for effective imposition of semantic structures.
  The model can alternatively be seen as enhancing VAEs with the wake-sleep algorithm
  for leveraging fake samples as extra training data. With differentiable approximation
  to discrete text samples, explicit constraints on independent attribute controls,
  and efficient collaborative learning of generator and discriminators, our model
  learns interpretable representations from even only word annotations, and produces
  short sentences with desired attributes of sentiment and tenses. Quantitative experiments
  using trained classifiers as evaluators validate the accuracy of sentence and attribute
  generation.
