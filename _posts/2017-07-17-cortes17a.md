abstract: We present a new framework for analyzing and learning artificial neural
  networks. Our approach simultaneously and adaptively learns both the structure of
  the network as well as its weights. The methodology is based upon and accompanied
  by strong data-dependent theoretical learning guarantees, so that the final network
  architecture provably adapts to the complexity of any given problem.
