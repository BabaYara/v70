abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of machine teaching, the inverse
  problem of machine learning. Different from traditional machine teaching which views
  the learners as batch algorithms, we study a new paradigm where the learner uses
  an iterative algorithm and a teacher can feed examples sequentially and intelligently
  based on the current performance of the learner. We show that the teaching complexity
  in the iterative case is very different from that in the batch case. Instead of
  constructing a minimal training set for learners, our iterative machine teaching
  focuses on achieving fast convergence in the learner model. Depending on the level
  of information the teacher has from the learner model, we design teaching algorithms
  which can provably reduce the number of teaching examples and achieve faster convergence
  than learning without teachers. We also validate our theoretical findings with extensive
  experiments on different data distribution and real image datasets.
