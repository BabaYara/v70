abstract: Coordinate descent (CD) is a scalable and simple algorithm for solving many
  optimization problems in machine learning. Despite this fact, CD can also be very
  computationally wasteful. Due to sparsity in sparse regression problems, for example,
  the majority of CD updates often result in no progress toward the solution. To address
  this inefficiency, we propose a modified CD algorithm named “StingyCD.” By skipping
  over many updates that are guaranteed to not decrease the objective value, StingyCD
  significantly reduces convergence times. Since StingyCD only skips updates with
  this guarantee, however, StingyCD does not fully exploit the problem’s sparsity.
  For this reason, we also propose StingyCD+, an algorithm that achieves further speed-ups
  by skipping updates more aggressively. Since StingyCD and StingyCD+ rely on simple
  modifications to CD, it is also straightforward to use these algorithms with other
  approaches to scaling optimization. In empirical comparisons, StingyCD and StingyCD+
  improve convergence times considerably for several L1-regularized optimization problems.
