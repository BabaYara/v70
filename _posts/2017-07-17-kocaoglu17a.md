abstract: 'We consider the problem of learning a causal graph over a set of variables
  with interventions. We study the cost-optimal causal graph learning problem: For
  a given skeleton (undirected version of the causal graph), design the set of interventions
  with minimum total cost, that can uniquely identify any causal graph with the given
  skeleton. We show that this problem is solvable in polynomial time. Later, we consider
  the case when the number of interventions is limited. For this case, we provide
  polynomial time algorithms when the skeleton is a tree or a clique tree. For a general
  chordal skeleton, we develop an efficient greedy algorithm, which can be improved
  when the causal graph skeleton is an interval graph.'
