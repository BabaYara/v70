abstract: 'Robust estimation is much more challenging in high-dimensions than it is
  in one-dimension: Most techniques either lead to intractable optimization problems
  or estimators that can tolerate only a tiny fraction of errors. Recent work in theoretical
  computer science has shown that, in appropriate distributional models, it is possible
  to robustly estimate the mean and covariance with polynomial time algorithms that
  can tolerate a constant fraction of corruptions, independent of the dimension. However,
  the sample and time complexity of these algorithms is prohibitively large for high-dimensional
  applications. In this work, we address both of these issues by establishing sample
  complexity bounds that are optimal, up to logarithmic factors, as well as giving
  various refinements that allow the algorithms to tolerate a much larger fraction
  of corruptions. Finally, we show on both synthetic and real data that our algorithms
  have state-of-the-art performance and suddenly make high-dimensional robust estimation
  a realistic possibility.'
