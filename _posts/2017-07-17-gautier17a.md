abstract: Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are distributions over sets of items
  that model diversity using kernels. Their applications in machine learning include
  summary extraction and recommendation systems. Yet, the cost of sampling from a
  DPP is prohibitive in large-scale applications, which has triggered an effort towards
  efficient approximate samplers. We build a novel MCMC sampler that combines ideas
  from combinatorial geometry, linear programming, and Monte Carlo methods to sample
  from DPPs with a fixed sample cardinality, also called projection DPPs. Our sampler
  leverages the ability of the hit-and-run MCMC kernel to efficiently move across
  convex bodies. Previous theoretical results yield a fast mixing time of our chain
  when targeting a distribution that is close to a projection DPP, but not a DPP in
  general. Our empirical results demonstrate that this extends to sampling projection
  DPPs, i.e., our sampler is more sample-efficient than previous approaches which
  in turn translates to faster convergence when dealing with costly-to-evaluate functions,
  such as summary extraction in our experiments.
