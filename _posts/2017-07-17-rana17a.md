abstract: Bayesian optimization is an efficient way to optimize expensive black-box
  functions such as designing a new product with highest quality or hyperparameter
  tuning of a machine learning algorithm. However, it has a serious limitation when
  the parameter space is high-dimensional as Bayesian optimization crucially depends
  on solving a global optimization of a surrogate utility function in the same sized
  dimensions. The surrogate utility function, known commonly as acquisition function
  is a continuous function but can be extremely sharp at high dimension - having only
  a few peaks marooned in a large terrain of almost flat surface. Global optimization
  algorithms such as DIRECT are infeasible at higher dimensions and gradient-dependent
  methods cannot move if initialized in the flat terrain. We propose an algorithm
  that enables local gradient-dependent algorithms to move through the flat terrain
  by using a sequence of gross-to-finer Gaussian process priors on the objective function
  as we leverage two underlying facts - a) there exists a large enough length-scales
  for which the acquisition function can be made to have a significant gradient at
  any location in the parameter space, and b) the extrema of the consecutive acquisition
  functions are close although they are different only due to a small difference in
  the length-scales. Theoretical guarantees are provided and experiments clearly demonstrate
  the utility of the proposed method at high dimension using both benchmark test functions
  and real-world case studies.
