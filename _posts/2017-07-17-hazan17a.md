abstract: We consider regret minimization in repeated games with non-convex loss functions.
  Minimizing the standard notion of regret is computationally intractable. Thus, we
  define a natural notion of regret which permits efficient optimization and generalizes
  offline guarantees for convergence to an approximate local optimum. We give gradient-based
  methods that achieve optimal regret, which in turn guarantee convergence to equilibrium
  in this framework.
