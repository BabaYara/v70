abstract: In recent years, the multiclass and mutlilabel classification problems we
  encounter in many applications have very large ($10^3$â€“$10^6$) number of classes.
  However, each instance belongs to only one or few classes, i.e., the label vectors
  are sparse. In this work, we propose a novel approach based on group testing to
  solve such large multilabel classification problems with sparse label vectors. We
  describe various group testing constructions, and advocate the use of concatenated
  Reed Solomon codes and unbalanced bipartite expander graphs for extreme classification
  problems. The proposed approach has several advantages theoretically and practically
  over existing popular methods. Our method operates on the binary alphabet and can
  utilize the well-established binary classifiers for learning. The error correction
  capabilities of the codes are leveraged for the first time in the learning problem
  to correct prediction errors. Even if a linearly growing number of classifiers mis-classify,
  these errors are fully corrected. We establish Hamming loss error bounds for the
  approach. More importantly, our method utilizes a simple prediction algorithm and
  does not require matrix inversion or solving optimization problems making the algorithm
  very inexpensive. Numerical experiments with various datasets illustrate the superior
  performance of our method.
