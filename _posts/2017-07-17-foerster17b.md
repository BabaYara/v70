abstract: 'Many real-world problems, such as network packet routing and urban traffic
  control, are naturally modeled as multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) problems.
  However, existing multi-agent RL methods typically scale poorly in the problem size.
  Therefore, a key challenge is to translate the success of deep learning on single-agent
  RL to the multi-agent setting. A major stumbling block is that independent Q-learning,
  the most popular multi-agent RL method, introduces nonstationarity that makes it
  incompatible with the experience replay memory on which deep Q-learning relies.
  This paper proposes two methods that address this problem: 1) using a multi-agent
  variant of importance sampling to naturally decay obsolete data and 2) conditioning
  each agentâ€™s value function on a fingerprint that disambiguates the age of the data
  sampled from the replay memory. Results on a challenging decentralised variant of
  StarCraft unit micromanagement confirm that these methods enable the successful
  combination of experience replay with multi-agent RL.'
