abstract: 'Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) are a family of probabilistic models
  that have a repulsive behavior, and lend themselves naturally to many tasks in machine
  learning where returning a diverse set of objects is important. While there are
  fast algorithms for sampling, marginalization and conditioning, much less is known
  about learning the parameters of a DPP. Our contribution is twofold: (i) we establish
  the optimal sample complexity achievable in this problem and show that it is governed
  by a natural parameter, which we call the cycle sparsity; (ii) we propose a provably
  fast combinatorial algorithm that implements the method of moments efficiently and
  achieves optimal sample complexity. Finally, we give experimental results that confirm
  our theoretical findings.'
