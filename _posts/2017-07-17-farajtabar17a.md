abstract: We propose the first multistage intervention framework that tackles fake
  news in social networks by combining reinforcement learning with a point process
  network activity model. The spread of fake news and mitigation events within the
  network is modeled by a multivariate Hawkes process with additional exogenous control
  terms. By choosing a feature representation of states, defining mitigation actions
  and constructing reward functions to measure the effectiveness of mitigation activities,
  we map the problem of fake news mitigation into the reinforcement learning framework.
  We develop a policy iteration method unique to the multivariate networked point
  process, with the goal of optimizing the actions for maximal reward under budget
  constraints. Our method shows promising performance in real-time intervention experiments
  on a Twitter network to mitigate a surrogate fake news campaign, and outperforms
  alternatives on synthetic datasets.
