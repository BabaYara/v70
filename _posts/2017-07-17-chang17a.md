abstract: Expert input can improve clustering performance. In today’s collaborative
  environment, the availability of crowdsourced multiple expert input is becoming
  common. Given multiple experts’ inputs, most existing approaches can only discover
  one clustering structure. However, data is multi-faced by nature and can be clustered
  in different ways (also known as views). In an exploratory analysis problem where
  ground truth is not known, different experts may have diverse views on how to cluster
  data. In this paper, we address the problem on how to automatically discover multiple
  ways to cluster data given potentially diverse inputs from multiple uncertain experts.
  We propose a novel Bayesian probabilistic model that automatically learns the multiple
  expert views and the clustering structure associated with each view. The benefits
  of learning the experts’ views include 1) enabling the discovery of multiple diverse
  clustering structures, and 2) improving the quality of clustering solution in each
  view by assigning higher weights to experts with higher confidence. In our approach,
  the expert views, multiple clustering structures and expert confidences are jointly
  learned via variational inference. Experimental results on synthetic datasets, benchmark
  datasets and a real-world disease subtyping problem show that our proposed approach
  outperforms competing baselines, including meta clustering, semi-supervised clustering,
  semi-crowdsourced clustering and consensus clustering.
