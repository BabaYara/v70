abstract: Most learning approaches treat dimensionality reduction (DR) and clustering
  separately (i.e., sequentially), but recent research has shown that optimizing the
  two tasks jointly can substantially improve the performance of both. The premise
  behind the latter genre is that the data samples are obtained via linear transformation
  of latent representations that are easy to cluster; but in practice, the transformation
  from the latent space to the data can be more complicated. In this work, we assume
  that this transformation is an unknown and possibly nonlinear function. To recover
  the `clustering-friendly’ latent representations and to better cluster the data,
  we propose a joint DR and K-means clustering approach in which DR is accomplished
  via learning a deep neural network (DNN). The motivation is to keep the advantages
  of jointly optimizing the two tasks, while exploiting the deep neural network’s
  ability to approximate any nonlinear function. This way, the proposed approach can
  work well for a broad class of generative models. Towards this end, we carefully
  design the DNN structure and the associated joint optimization criterion, and propose
  an effective and scalable algorithm to handle the formulated optimization problem.
  Experiments using different real datasets are employed to showcase the effectiveness
  of the proposed approach.
