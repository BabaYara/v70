abstract: Rapid learning requires flexible representations to quickly adopt to new
  evidence. We develop a novel class of models called Attentive Recurrent Comparators
  (ARCs) that form representations of objects by cycling through them and making observations.
  Using the representations extracted by ARCs, we develop a way of approximating a
  <em>dynamic representation space</em> and use it for one-shot learning. In the task
  of one-shot classification on the Omniglot dataset, we achieve the state of the
  art performance with an error rate of 1.5\%. This represents the first super-human
  result achieved for this task with a generic model that uses only pixel information.
