abstract: The problem of on-line off-policy evaluation (OPE) has been actively studied
  in the last decade due to its importance both as a stand-alone problem and as a
  module in a policy improvement scheme. However, most Temporal Difference (TD) based
  solutions ignore the discrepancy between the stationary distribution of the behavior
  and target policies and its effect on the convergence limit when function approximation
  is applied. In this paper we propose the Consistent Off-Policy Temporal Difference
  (COP-TD($\lambda$, $\beta$)) algorithm that addresses this issue and reduces this
  bias at some computational expense. We show that COP-TD($\lambda$, $\beta$) can
  be designed to converge to the same value that would have been obtained by using
  on-policy TD($\lambda$) with the target policy. Subsequently, the proposed scheme
  leads to a related and promising heuristic we call log-COP-TD($\lambda$, $\beta$).
  Both algorithms have favorable empirical results to the current state of the art
  on-line OPE algorithms. Finally, our formulation sheds some new light on the recently
  proposed Emphatic TD learning.
