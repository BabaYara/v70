abstract: Relational data are usually highly incomplete in practice, which inspires
  us to leverage side information to improve the performance of community detection
  and link prediction. This paper presents a Bayesian probabilistic approach that
  incorporates various kinds of node attributes encoded in binary form in relational
  models with Poisson likelihood. Our method works flexibly with both directed and
  undirected relational networks. The inference can be done by efficient Gibbs sampling
  which leverages sparsity of both networks and node attributes. Extensive experiments
  show that our models achieve the state-of-the-art link prediction results, especially
  with highly incomplete relational data.
