abstract: The Multi-Armed Bandit problem with Unobserved Confounders (MABUC) considers
  decision-making settings where unmeasured variables can influence both the agent’s
  decisions and received rewards (Bareinboim et al., 2015). Recent findings showed
  that unobserved confounders (UCs) pose a unique challenge to algorithms based on
  standard randomization (i.e., experimental data); if UCs are naively averaged out,
  these algorithms behave sub-optimally, possibly incurring infinite regret. In this
  paper, we show how counterfactual-based decision-making circumvents these problems
  and leads to a coherent fusion of observational and experimental data. We then demonstrate
  this new strategy in an enhanced Thompson Sampling bandit player, and support our
  findings’ efficacy with extensive simulations.
