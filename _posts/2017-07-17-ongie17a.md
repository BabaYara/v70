abstract: We consider a non-linear generalization of low-rank matrix completion to
  the case where the data belongs to an algebraic variety, i.e., each data point is
  a solution to a system of polynomial equations. In this case the original matrix
  is possibly high-rank, but it becomes low-rank after mapping each column to a higher
  dimensional space of monomial features. Algebraic varieties capture a range of well-studied
  linear models, including affine subspaces and their union, but also quadratic and
  higher degree curves and surfaces. We study the sampling requirements for a general
  variety model with a focus on the union of affine subspaces. We propose an efficient
  matrix completion algorithm that minimizes a convex or non-convex surrogate of the
  rank of the lifted matrix. Our algorithm uses the well-known “kernel trick” to avoid
  working directly with the high-dimensional lifted data matrix and scales efficiently
  with data size. We show the proposed algorithm is able to recover synthetically
  generated data up to the predicted sampling complexity bounds. The algorithm also
  outperforms standard techniques in experiments with real data.
