abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate how to learn the objective function of a decision
  maker while only observing the problem input data and the decision maker’s corresponding
  decisions over multiple rounds. Our approach is based on online learning techniques
  and works for linear objectives over arbitrary sets for which we have a linear optimization
  oracle and as such generalizes previous work based on KKT-system decomposition and
  dualization approaches. The applicability of our framework for learning linear constraints
  is also discussed briefly. Our algorithm converges at a rate of O(1/sqrt(T)), and
  we demonstrate its effectiveness and applications in preliminary computational results.
