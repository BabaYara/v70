abstract: 'We introduce FeUdal Networks (FuNs): a novel architecture for hierarchical
  reinforcement learning. Our approach is inspired by the feudal reinforcement learning
  proposal of Dayan and Hinton, and gains power and efficacy by decoupling end-to-end
  learning across multiple levels – allowing it to utilise different resolutions of
  time. Our framework employs a Manager module and a Worker module. The Manager operates
  at a slower time scale and sets abstract goals which are conveyed to and enacted
  by the Worker. The Worker generates primitive actions at every tick of the environment.
  The decoupled structure of FuN conveys several benefits – in addition to facilitating
  very long timescale credit assignment it also encourages the emergence of sub-policies
  associated with different goals set by the Manager. These properties allow FuN to
  dramatically outperform a strong baseline agent on tasks that involve long-term
  credit assignment or memorisation.'
