abstract: Diffusions and related random walk procedures are of central importance
  in many areas of machine learning, data analysis, and applied mathematics. Because
  they spread mass agnostically at each step in an iterative manner, they can sometimes
  spread mass “too aggressively,” thereby failing to find the “right” clusters. We
  introduce a novel Capacity Releasing Diffusion (CRD) Process, which is both faster
  and stays more local than the classical spectral diffusion process. As an application,
  we use our CRD Process to develop an improved local algorithm for graph clustering.
  Our local graph clustering method can find local clusters in a model of clustering
  where one begins the CRD Process in a cluster whose vertices are connected better
  internally than externally by an $O(\log^2 n)$ factor, where $n$ is the number of
  nodes in the cluster. Thus, our CRD Process is the first local graph clustering
  algorithm that is not subject to the well-known quadratic Cheeger barrier. Our result
  requires a certain smoothness condition, which we expect to be an artifact of our
  analysis. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates improved results, in particular
  for realistic social graphs where there are moderately good—but not very good—clusters.
