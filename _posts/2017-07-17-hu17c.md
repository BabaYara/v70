abstract: Modeling temporal sequences plays a fundamental role in various modern applications
  and has drawn more and more attentions in the machine learning community. Among
  those efforts on improving the capability to represent temporal data, the Long Short-Term
  Memory (LSTM) has achieved great success in many areas. Although the LSTM can capture
  long-range dependency in the time domain, it does not explicitly model the pattern
  occurrences in the frequency domain that plays an important role in tracking and
  predicting data points over various time cycles. We propose the State-Frequency
  Memory (SFM), a novel recurrent architecture that allows to separate dynamic patterns
  across different frequency components and their impacts on modeling the temporal
  contexts of input sequences. By jointly decomposing memorized dynamics into state-frequency
  components, the SFM is able to offer a fine-grained analysis of temporal sequences
  by capturing the dependency of uncovered patterns in both time and frequency domains.
  Evaluations on several temporal modeling tasks demonstrate the SFM can yield competitive
  performances, in particular as compared with the state-of-the-art LSTM models.
