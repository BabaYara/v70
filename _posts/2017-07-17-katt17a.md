abstract: The POMDP is a powerful framework for reasoning under outcome and information
  uncertainty, but constructing an accurate POMDP model is difficult. Bayes-Adaptive
  Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (BA-POMDPs) extend POMDPs to allow
  the model to be learned during execution. BA-POMDPs are a Bayesian RL approach that,
  in principle, allows for an optimal trade-off between exploitation and exploration.
  Unfortunately, BA-POMDPs are currently impractical to solve for any non-trivial
  domain. In this paper, we extend the Monte-Carlo Tree Search method POMCP to BA-POMDPs
  and show that the resulting method, which we call BA-POMCP, is able to tackle problems
  that previous solution methods have been unable to solve. Additionally, we introduce
  several techniques that exploit the BA-POMDP structure to improve the efficiency
  of BA-POMCP along with proof of their convergence.
