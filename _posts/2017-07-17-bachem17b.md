abstract: The k-Means++ algorithm is the state of the art algorithm to solve k-Means
  clustering problems as the computed clusterings are O(log k) competitive in expectation.
  However, its seeding step requires k inherently sequential passes through the full
  data set making it hard to scale to massive data sets. The standard remedy is to
  use the k-Means|| algorithm which reduces the number of sequential rounds and is
  thus suitable for a distributed setting. In this paper, we provide a novel analysis
  of the k-Means|| algorithm that bounds the expected solution quality for any number
  of rounds and oversampling factors greater than k, the two parameters one needs
  to choose in practice. In particular, we show that k-Means|| provides <em>provably
  good</em> clusterings even for a small, constant number of iterations. This theoretical
  finding explains the common observation that k-Means|| performs extremely well in
  practice even if the number of rounds is low. We further provide a hard instance
  that shows that an <em>additive</em> error term as encountered in our analysis is
  inevitable if less than k-1 rounds are employed.
