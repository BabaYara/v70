abstract: 'In many real-world scenarios, rewards extrinsic to the agent are extremely
  sparse, or absent altogether. In such cases, curiosity can serve as an intrinsic
  reward signal to enable the agent to explore its environment and learn skills that
  might be useful later in its life. We formulate curiosity as the error in an agentâ€™s
  ability to predict the consequence of its own actions in a visual feature space
  learned by a self-supervised inverse dynamics model. Our formulation scales to high-dimensional
  continuous state spaces like images, bypasses the difficulties of directly predicting
  pixels, and, critically, ignores the aspects of the environment that cannot affect
  the agent. The proposed approach is evaluated in two environments: VizDoom and Super
  Mario Bros. Three broad settings are investigated: 1) sparse extrinsic reward, where
  curiosity allows for far fewer interactions with the environment to reach the goal;
  2) exploration with no extrinsic reward, where curiosity pushes the agent to explore
  more efficiently; and 3) generalization to unseen scenarios (e.g. new levels of
  the same game) where the knowledge gained from earlier experience helps the agent
  explore new places much faster than starting from scratch.'
