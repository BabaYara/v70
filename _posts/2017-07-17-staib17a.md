abstract: The optimal allocation of resources for maximizing influence, spread of
  information or coverage, has gained attention in the past years, in particular in
  machine learning and data mining. But in applications, the parameters of the problem
  are rarely known exactly, and using wrong parameters can lead to undesirable outcomes.
  We hence revisit a continuous version of the Budget Allocation or Bipartite Influence
  Maximization problem introduced by Alon et al. (2012) from a robust optimization
  perspective, where an adversary may choose the least favorable parameters within
  a confidence set. The resulting problem is a nonconvex-concave saddle point problem
  (or game). We show that this nonconvex problem can be solved exactly by leveraging
  connections to continuous submodular functions, and by solving a constrained submodular
  minimization problem. Although constrained submodular minimization is hard in general,
  here, we establish conditions under which such a problem can be solved to arbitrary
  precision $\epsilon$.
