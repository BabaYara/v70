abstract: Optimization of high-dimensional black-box functions is an extremely challenging
  problem. While Bayesian optimization has emerged as a popular approach for optimizing
  black-box functions, its applicability has been limited to low-dimensional problems
  due to its computational and statistical challenges arising from high-dimensional
  settings. In this paper, we propose to tackle these challenges by (1) assuming a
  latent additive structure in the function and inferring it properly for more efficient
  and effective BO, and (2) performing multiple evaluations in parallel to reduce
  the number of iterations required by the method. Our novel approach learns the latent
  structure with Gibbs sampling and constructs batched queries using determinantal
  point processes. Experimental validations on both synthetic and real-world functions
  demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches.
