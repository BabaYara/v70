abstract: Given samples from a distribution, how many new elements should we expect
  to find if we keep on sampling this distribution? This is an important and actively
  studied problem, with many applications ranging from species estimation to genomics.
  We generalize this extrapolation and related unseen estimation problems to the multiple
  population setting, where population $j$ has an unknown distribution $D_j$ from
  which we observe $n_j$ samples. We derive an optimal estimator for the total number
  of elements we expect to find among new samples across the populations. Surprisingly,
  we prove that our estimatorâ€™s accuracy is independent of the number of populations.
  We also develop an efficient optimization algorithm to solve the more general problem
  of estimating multi-population frequency distributions. We validate our methods
  and theory through extensive experiments. Finally, on a real dataset of human genomes
  across multiple ancestries, we demonstrate how our approach for unseen estimation
  can enable cohort designs that can discover interesting mutations with greater efficiency.
