abstract: 'We study the problem of learning to choose from $m$ discrete treatment
  options (e.g., news item or medical drug) the one with best causal effect for a
  particular instance (e.g., user or patient) where the training data consists of
  passive observations of covariates, treatment, and the outcome of the treatment.
  The standard approach to this problem is regress and compare: split the training
  data by treatment, fit a regression model in each split, and, for a new instance,
  predict all $m$ outcomes and pick the best. By reformulating the problem as a single
  learning task rather than $m$ separate ones, we propose a new approach based on
  recursively partitioning the data into regimes where different treatments are optimal.
  We extend this approach to an optimal partitioning approach that finds a globally
  optimal partition, achieving a compact, interpretable, and impactful personalization
  model. We develop new tools for validating and evaluating personalization models
  on observational data and use these to demonstrate the power of our novel approaches
  in a personalized medicine and a job training application.'
