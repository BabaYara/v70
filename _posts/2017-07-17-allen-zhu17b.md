abstract: 'We study k-GenEV, the problem of finding the top k generalized eigenvectors,
  and k-CCA, the problem of finding the top k vectors in canonical-correlation analysis.
  We propose algorithms LazyEV and LazyCCA to solve the two problems with running
  times linearly dependent on the input size and on k. Furthermore, our algorithms
  are <em>doubly-accelerated</em>: our running times depend only on the square root
  of the matrix condition number, and on the square root of the eigengap. This is
  the first such result for both k-GenEV or k-CCA. We also provide the first gap-free
  results, which provide running times that depend on $1/\sqrt{\varepsilon}$ rather
  than the eigengap.'
