abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms for real-world robotic applications must
  be able to handle complex, unknown dynamical systems while maintaining data-efficient
  learning. These requirements are handled well by model-free and model-based RL approaches,
  respectively. In this work, we aim to combine the advantages of these approaches.
  By focusing on time-varying linear-Gaussian policies, we enable a model-based algorithm
  based on the linear-quadratic regulator that can be integrated into the model-free
  framework of path integral policy improvement. We can further combine our method
  with guided policy search to train arbitrary parameterized policies such as deep
  neural networks. Our simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that this
  method can solve challenging manipulation tasks with comparable or better performance
  than model-free methods while maintaining the sample efficiency of model-based methods.
