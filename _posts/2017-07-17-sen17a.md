abstract: Motivated by applications in computational advertising and systems biology,
  we consider the problem of identifying the best out of several possible soft interventions
  at a source node $V$ in an acyclic causal directed graph, to maximize the expected
  value of a target node $Y$ (located downstream of $V$). Our setting imposes a fixed
  total budget for sampling under various interventions, along with cost constraints
  on different types of interventions. We pose this as a best arm identification bandit
  problem with $K$ arms, where each arm is a soft intervention at $V$ and leverage
  the information leakage among the arms to provide the first gap dependent error
  and simple regret bounds for this problem. Our results are a significant improvement
  over the traditional best arm identification results. We empirically show that our
  algorithms outperform the state of the art in the Flow Cytometry data-set, and also
  apply our algorithm for model interpretation of the Inception-v3 deep net that classifies
  images.
