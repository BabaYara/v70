abstract: Most of the semi-supervised classification methods developed so far use
  unlabeled data for regularization purposes under particular distributional assumptions
  such as the cluster assumption. In contrast, recently developed methods of classification
  from positive and unlabeled data (PU classification) use unlabeled data for risk
  evaluation, i.e., label information is directly extracted from unlabeled data. In
  this paper, we extend PU classification to also incorporate negative data and propose
  a novel semi-supervised learning approach. We establish generalization error bounds
  for our novel methods and show that the bounds decrease with respect to the number
  of unlabeled data without the distributional assumptions that are required in existing
  semi-supervised learning methods. Through experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness
  of the proposed methods.
