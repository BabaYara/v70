abstract: 'Bayesian optimization has been successfully used to optimize complex black-box
  functions whose evaluations are expensive. In many applications, like in deep learning
  and predictive analytics, the optimization domain is itself complex and structured.
  In this work, we focus on use cases where this domain exhibits a known dependency
  structure. The benefit of leveraging this structure is twofold: we explore the search
  space more efficiently and posterior inference scales more favorably with the number
  of observations than Gaussian Process-based approaches published in the literature.
  We introduce a novel surrogate model for Bayesian optimization which combines independent
  Gaussian Processes with a linear model that encodes a tree-based dependency structure
  and can transfer information between overlapping decision sequences. We also design
  a specialized two-step acquisition function that explores the search space more
  effectively. Our experiments on synthetic tree-structured functions and the tuning
  of feedforward neural networks trained on a range of binary classification datasets
  show that our method compares favorably with competing approaches.'
