abstract: This paper investigates the problem of interactively learning behaviors
  communicated by a human teacher using positive and negative feedback. Much previous
  work on this problem has made the assumption that people provide feedback for decisions
  that is dependent on the behavior they are teaching and is independent from the
  learner’s current policy. We present empirical results that show this assumption
  to be false—whether human trainers give a positive or negative feedback for a decision
  is influenced by the learner’s current policy. Based on this insight, we introduce
  Convergent Actor-Critic by Humans (COACH), an algorithm for learning from policy-dependent
  feedback that converges to a local optimum. Finally, we demonstrate that COACH can
  successfully learn multiple behaviors on a physical robot.
