abstract: We provide new approximation guarantees for greedy low rank matrix estimation
  under standard assumptions of restricted strong convexity and smoothness. Our novel
  analysis also uncovers previously unknown connections between the low rank estimation
  and combinatorial optimization, so much so that our bounds are reminiscent of corresponding
  approximation bounds in submodular maximization. Additionally, we provide also provide
  statistical recovery guarantees. Finally, we present empirical comparison of greedy
  estimation with established baselines on two important real-world problems.
