abstract: Causal inference among high-dimensional time series data proves an important
  research problem in many fields. While in the classical regime one often establishes
  causality among time series via a concept known as “Granger causality,” existing
  approaches for Granger causal inference in high-dimensional data lack the means
  to characterize the uncertainty associated with Granger causality estimates (e.g.,
  p-values and confidence intervals). We make two contributions in this work. First,
  we introduce a novel asymptotically unbiased Granger causality estimator with corresponding
  test statistics and confidence intervals to allow, for the first time, uncertainty
  characterization in high-dimensional Granger causal inference. Second, we introduce
  a novel method for false discovery rate control that achieves higher power in multiple
  testing than existing techniques and that can cope with dependent test statistics
  and dependent observations. We corroborate our theoretical results with experiments
  on both synthetic data and real-world climatological data.
