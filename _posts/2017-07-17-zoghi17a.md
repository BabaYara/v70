abstract: Online learning to rank is a core problem in information retrieval and machine
  learning. Many provably efficient algorithms have been recently proposed for this
  problem in specific click models. The click model is a model of how the user interacts
  with a list of documents. Though these results are significant, their impact on
  practice is limited, because all proposed algorithms are designed for specific click
  models and lack convergence guarantees in other models. In this work, we propose
  BatchRank, the first online learning to rank algorithm for a broad class of click
  models. The class encompasses two most fundamental click models, the cascade and
  position-based models. We derive a gap-dependent upper bound on the T-step regret
  of BatchRank and evaluate it on a range of web search queries. We observe that BatchRank
  outperforms ranked bandits and is more robust than CascadeKL-UCB, an existing algorithm
  for the cascade model.
