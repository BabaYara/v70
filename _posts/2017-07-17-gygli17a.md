abstract: We approach structured output prediction by optimizing a deep value network
  (DVN) to precisely estimate the task loss on different output configurations for
  a given input. Once the model is trained, we perform inference by gradient descent
  on the continuous relaxations of the output variables to find outputs with promising
  scores from the value network. When applied to image segmentation, the value network
  takes an image and a segmentation mask as inputs and predicts a scalar estimating
  the intersection over union between the input and ground truth masks. For multi-label
  classification, the DVNâ€™s objective is to correctly predict the F1 score for any
  potential label configuration. The DVN framework achieves the state-of-the-art results
  on multi-label prediction and image segmentation benchmarks.
