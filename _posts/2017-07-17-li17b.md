abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization is a basic tool for decomposing data into
  the feature and weight matrices under non-negativity constraints, and in practice
  is often solved in the alternating minimization framework. However, it is unclear
  whether such algorithms can recover the ground-truth feature matrix when the weights
  for different features are highly correlated, which is common in applications. This
  paper proposes a simple and natural alternating gradient descent based algorithm,
  and shows that with a mild initialization it provably recovers the ground-truth
  in the presence of strong correlations. In most interesting cases, the correlation
  can be in the same order as the highest possible. Our analysis also reveals its
  several favorable features including robustness to noise. We complement our theoretical
  results with empirical studies on semi-synthetic datasets, demonstrating its advantage
  over several popular methods in recovering the ground-truth.
