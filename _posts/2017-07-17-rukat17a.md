abstract: 'Boolean matrix factorisation aims to decompose a binary data matrix into
  an approximate Boolean product of two low rank, binary matrices: one containing
  meaningful patterns, the other quantifying how the observations can be expressed
  as a combination of these patterns. We introduce the OrMachine, a probabilistic
  generative model for Boolean matrix factorisation and derive a Metropolised Gibbs
  sampler that facilitates efficient parallel posterior inference. On real world and
  simulated data, our method outperforms all currently existing approaches for Boolean
  matrix factorisation and completion. This is the first method to provide full posterior
  inference for Boolean Matrix factorisation which is relevant in applications, e.g.
  for controlling false positive rates in collaborative filtering and, crucially,
  improves the interpretability of the inferred patterns. The proposed algorithm scales
  to large datasets as we demonstrate by analysing single cell gene expression data
  in 1.3 million mouse brain cells across 11 thousand genes on commodity hardware.'
