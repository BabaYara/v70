abstract: While crowdsourcing has been a cost and time efficient method to label massive
  samples, one critical issue is quality control, for which the key challenge is to
  infer the ground truth from noisy or even adversarial data by various users. A large
  class of crowdsourcing problems, such as those involving age, grade, level, or stage,
  have an ordinal structure in their labels. Based on a technique of sampling estimated
  label from the posterior distribution, we define a novel separating width among
  the labeled observations to characterize the quality of sampled labels, and develop
  an efficient algorithm to optimize it through solving multiple linear decision boundaries
  and adjusting prior distributions. Our algorithm is empirically evaluated on several
  real world datasets, and demonstrates its supremacy over state-of-the-art methods.
