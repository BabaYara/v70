abstract: How can we summarize a dynamic data stream when elements selected for the
  summary can be deleted at any time? This is an important challenge in online services,
  where the users generating the data may decide to exercise their right to restrict
  the service provider from using (part of) their data due to privacy concerns. Motivated
  by this challenge, we introduce the dynamic deletion-robust submodular maximization
  problem. We develop the first resilient streaming algorithm, called ROBUST-STREAMING,
  with a constant factor approximation guarantee to the optimum solution. We evaluate
  the effectiveness of our approach on several real-world applica tions, including
  summarizing (1) streams of geo-coordinates (2); streams of images; and (3) click-stream
  log data, consisting of 45 million feature vectors from a news recommendation task.
