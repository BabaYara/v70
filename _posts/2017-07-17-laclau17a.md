abstract: In this paper, we present a novel method for co-clustering, an unsupervised
  learning approach that aims at discovering homogeneous groups of data instances
  and features by grouping them simultaneously. The proposed method uses the entropy
  regularized optimal transport between empirical measures defined on data instances
  and features in order to obtain an estimated joint probability density function
  represented by the optimal coupling matrix. This matrix is further factorized to
  obtain the induced row and columns partitions using multiscale representations approach.
  To justify our method theoretically, we show how the solution of the regularized
  optimal transport can be seen from the variational inference perspective thus motivating
  its use for co-clustering. The algorithm derived for the proposed method and its
  kernelized version based on the notion of Gromov-Wasserstein distance are fast,
  accurate and can determine automatically the number of both row and column clusters.
  These features are vividly demonstrated through extensive experimental evaluations.
