abstract: Word embeddings are a widely-used tool to analyze language, and exponential
  family embeddings (Rudolph et al., 2016) generalize the technique to other types
  of data. One challenge to fitting embedding methods is sparse data, such as a document/term
  matrix that contains many zeros. To address this issue, practitioners typically
  downweight or subsample the zeros, thus focusing learning on the non-zero entries.
  In this paper, we develop zero-inflated embeddings, a new embedding method that
  is designed to learn from sparse observations. In a zero-inflated embedding (ZIE),
  a zero in the data can come from an interaction to other data (i.e., an embedding)
  or from a separate process by which many observations are equal to zero (i.e. a
  probability mass at zero). Fitting a ZIE naturally downweights the zeros and dampens
  their influence on the model. Across many types of data—language, movie ratings,
  shopping histories, and bird watching logs—we found that zero-inflated embeddings
  provide improved predictive performance over standard approaches and find better
  vector representation of items.
