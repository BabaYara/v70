abstract: 'Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are popular probabilistic models that
  arise in many machine learning tasks, where distributions of diverse sets are characterized
  by determinants of their features. In this paper, we develop fast algorithms to
  find the most likely configuration (MAP) of large-scale DPPs, which is NP-hard in
  general. Due to the submodular nature of the MAP objective, greedy algorithms have
  been used with empirical success. Greedy implementations require computation of
  log-determinants, matrix inverses or solving linear systems at each iteration. We
  present faster implementations of the greedy algorithms by utilizing the orthogonal
  benefits of two log-determinant approximation schemes: (a) first-order expansions
  to the matrix log-determinant function and (b) high-order expansions to the scalar
  log function with stochastic trace estimators. In our experiments, our algorithms
  are orders of magnitude faster than their competitors, while sacrificing marginal
  accuracy.'
