abstract: An important mobile health (mHealth) task is the use of multimodal data,
  such as sensor streams and self-report, to construct interpretable time-to-event
  predictions of, for example, lapse to alcohol or illicit drug use. Interpretability
  of the prediction model is important for acceptance and adoption by domain scientists,
  enabling model outputs and parameters to inform theory and guide intervention design.
  Temporal latent state models are therefore attractive, and so we adopt the continuous
  time hidden Markov model (CT-HMM) due to its ability to describe irregular arrival
  times of event data. Standard CT-HMMs, however, are not specialized for predicting
  the time to a future event, the key variable for mHealth interventions. Also, standard
  emission models lack a sufficiently rich structure to describe multimodal data and
  incorporate domain knowledge. We present iSurvive, an extension of classical survival
  analysis to a CT-HMM. We present a parameter learning method for GLM emissions and
  survival model fitting, and present promising results on both synthetic data and
  an mHealth drug use dataset.
