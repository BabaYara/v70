abstract: Efficient simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow is a
  long standing problem in applied mathematics, for which state-of-the-art methods
  require large compute resources. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach
  that leverages the approximation power of deep-learning with the precision of standard
  solvers to obtain fast and highly realistic simulations. Our method solves the incompressible
  Euler equations using the standard operator splitting method, in which a large sparse
  linear system with many free parameters must be solved. We use a Convolutional Network
  with a highly tailored architecture, trained using a novel unsupervised learning
  framework to solve the linear system. We present real-time 2D and 3D simulations
  that outperform recently proposed data-driven methods; the obtained results are
  realistic and show good generalization properties.
