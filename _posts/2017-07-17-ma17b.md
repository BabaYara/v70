abstract: Co-training is a well-known semi-supervised learning approach which trains
  classifiers on two different views and exchanges labels of unlabeled instances in
  an iterative way. During co-training process, labels of unlabeled instances in the
  training pool are very likely to be false especially in the initial training rounds,
  while the standard co-training algorithm utilizes a “draw without replacement” manner
  and does not remove these false labeled instances from training. This issue not
  only tends to degenerate its performance but also hampers its fundamental theory.
  Besides, there is no optimization model to explain what objective a cotraining process
  optimizes. To these issues, in this study we design a new co-training algorithm
  named self-paced cotraining (SPaCo) with a “draw with replacement” learning mode.
  The rationality of SPaCo can be proved under theoretical assumptions utilized in
  traditional co-training research, and furthermore, the algorithm exactly complies
  with the alternative optimization process for an optimization model of self-paced
  curriculum learning, which can be finely explained in robust learning manner. Experimental
  results substantiate the superiority of the proposed method as compared with current
  state-of-the-art co-training methods.
