abstract: Hierarchical architectures are critical to the scalability of reinforcement
  learning methods. Most current hierarchical frameworks execute actions serially,
  with macro-actions comprising sequences of primitive actions. We propose a novel
  alternative to these control hierarchies based on concurrent execution of many actions
  in parallel. Our scheme exploits the guaranteed concurrent compositionality provided
  by the linearly solvable Markov decision process (LMDP) framework, which naturally
  enables a learning agent to draw on several macro-actions simultaneously to solve
  new tasks. We introduce the Multitask LMDP module, which maintains a parallel distributed
  representation of tasks and may be stacked to form deep hierarchies abstracted in
  space and time.
