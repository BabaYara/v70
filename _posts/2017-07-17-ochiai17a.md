abstract: 'The field of speech recognition is in the midst of a paradigm shift: end-to-end
  neural networks are challenging the dominance of hidden Markov models as a core
  technology. Using an attention mechanism in a recurrent encoder-decoder architecture
  solves the dynamic time alignment problem, allowing joint end-to-end training of
  the acoustic and language modeling components. In this paper we extend the end-to-end
  framework to encompass microphone array signal processing for noise suppression
  and speech enhancement within the acoustic encoding network. This allows the beamforming
  components to be optimized jointly within the recognition architecture to improve
  the end-to-end speech recognition objective. Experiments on the noisy speech benchmarks
  (CHiME-4 and AMI) show that our multichannel end-to-end system outperformed the
  attention-based baseline with input from a conventional adaptive beamformer.'
