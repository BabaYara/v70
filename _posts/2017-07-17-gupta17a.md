abstract: 'Several real-world applications require real-time prediction on resource-scarce
  devices such as an Internet of Things (IoT) sensor. Such applications demand prediction
  models with small storage and computational complexity that do not compromise significantly
  on accuracy. In this work, we propose ProtoNN, a novel algorithm that addresses
  the problem of real-time and accurate prediction on resource-scarce devices. ProtoNN
  is inspired by k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) but has several orders lower storage and
  prediction complexity. ProtoNN models can be deployed even on devices with puny
  storage and computational power (e.g. an Arduino UNO with 2kB RAM) to get excellent
  prediction accuracy. ProtoNN derives its strength from three key ideas: a) learning
  a small number of prototypes to represent the entire training set, b) sparse low
  dimensional projection of data, c) joint discriminative learning of the projection
  and prototypes with explicit model size constraint. We conduct systematic empirical
  evaluation of ProtoNN on a variety of supervised learning tasks (binary, multi-class,
  multi-label classification) and show that it gives nearly state-of-the-art prediction
  accuracy on resource-scarce devices while consuming several orders lower storage,
  and using minimal working memory.'
