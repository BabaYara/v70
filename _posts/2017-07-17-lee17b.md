abstract: 'Ensemble methods are arguably the most trustworthy techniques for boosting
  the performance of machine learning models. Popular independent ensembles (IE) relying
  on naive averaging/voting scheme have been of typical choice for most applications
  involving deep neural networks, but they do not consider advanced collaboration
  among ensemble models. In this paper, we propose new ensemble methods specialized
  for deep neural networks, called confident multiple choice learning (CMCL): it is
  a variant of multiple choice learning (MCL) via addressing its overconfidence issue.In
  particular, the proposed major components of CMCL beyond the original MCL scheme
  are (i) new loss, i.e., confident oracle loss, (ii) new architecture, i.e., feature
  sharing and (iii) new training method, i.e., stochastic labeling. We demonstrate
  the effect of CMCL via experiments on the image classification on CIFAR and SVHN,
  and the foreground-background segmentation on the iCoseg. In particular, CMCL using
  5 residual networks provides 14.05\% and 6.60\% relative reductions in the top-1
  error rates from the corresponding IE scheme for the classification task on CIFAR
  and SVHN, respectively.'
