abstract: In recent years, Deep Learning has become the go-to solution for a broad
  range of applications, often outperforming state-of-the-art. However, it is important,
  for both theoreticians and practitioners, to gain a deeper understanding of the
  difficulties and limitations associated with common approaches and algorithms. We
  describe four types of simple problems, for which the gradient-based algorithms
  commonly used in deep learning either fail or suffer from significant difficulties.
  We illustrate the failures through practical experiments, and provide theoretical
  insights explaining their source, and how they might be remedied.
