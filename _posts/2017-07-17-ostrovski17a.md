abstract: 'Bellemare et al. (2016) introduced the notion of a pseudo-count, derived
  from a density model, to generalize count-based exploration to non-tabular reinforcement
  learning. This pseudo-count was used to generate an exploration bonus for a DQN
  agent and combined with a mixed Monte Carlo update was sufficient to achieve state
  of the art on the Atari 2600 game Montezuma’s Revenge. We consider two questions
  left open by their work: First, how important is the quality of the density model
  for exploration? Second, what role does the Monte Carlo update play in exploration?
  We answer the first question by demonstrating the use of PixelCNN, an advanced neural
  density model for images, to supply a pseudo-count. In particular, we examine the
  intrinsic difficulties in adapting Bellemare et al.’s approach when assumptions
  about the model are violated. The result is a more practical and general algorithm
  requiring no special apparatus. We combine PixelCNN pseudo-counts with different
  agent architectures to dramatically improve the state of the art on several hard
  Atari games. One surprising finding is that the mixed Monte Carlo update is a powerful
  facilitator of exploration in the sparsest of settings, including Montezuma’s Revenge.'
