abstract: We introduce a stochastic version of the non-reversible, rejection-free
  Bouncy Particle Sampler (BPS), a Markov process whose sample trajectories are piecewise
  linear, to efficiently sample Bayesian posteriors in big datasets. We prove that
  in the BPS no bias is introduced by noisy evaluations of the log-likelihood gradient.
  On the other hand, we argue that efficiency considerations favor a small, controllable
  bias, in exchange for faster mixing. We introduce a simple method that controls
  this trade-off. We illustrate these ideas in several examples which outperform previous
  approaches.
