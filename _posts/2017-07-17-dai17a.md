abstract: Learning-based binary hashing has become a powerful paradigm for fast search
  and retrieval in massive databases. However, due to the requirement of discrete
  outputs for the hash functions, learning such functions is known to be very challenging.
  In addition, the objective functions adopted by existing hashing techniques are
  mostly chosen heuristically. In this paper, we propose a novel generative approach
  to learn hash functions through Minimum Description Length principle such that the
  learned hash codes maximally compress the dataset and can also be used to regenerate
  the inputs. We also develop an efficient learning algorithm based on the stochastic
  distributional gradient, which avoids the notorious difficulty caused by binary
  output constraints, to jointly optimize the parameters of the hash function and
  the associated generative model. Extensive experiments on a variety of large-scale
  datasets show that the proposed method achieves better retrieval results than the
  existing state-of-the-art methods.
