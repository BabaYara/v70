abstract: Consider the regularized sparse minimization problem, which involves empirical
  sums of loss functions for $n$ data points (each of dimension $d$) and a nonconvex
  sparsity penalty. We prove that finding an $\mathcalO(n^c_1d^c_2)$-optimal solution
  to the regularized sparse optimization problem is strongly NP-hard for any $c_1,
  c_2âˆˆ[0,1)$ such that $c_1+c_2<1$. The result applies to a broad class of loss functions
  and sparse penalty functions. It suggests that one cannot even approximately solve
  the sparse optimization problem in polynomial time, unless P $=$ NP.
