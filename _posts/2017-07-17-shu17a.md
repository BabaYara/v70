abstract: We introduce a new framework for training deep generative models for high-dimensional
  conditional density estimation. The Bottleneck Conditional Density Estimator (BCDE)
  is a variant of the conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) that employs layer(s)
  of stochastic variables as the bottleneck between the input x and target y, where
  both are high-dimensional. Crucially, we propose a new hybrid training method that
  blends the conditional generative model with a joint generative model. Hybrid blending
  is the key to effective training of the BCDE, which avoids overfitting and provides
  a novel mechanism for leveraging unlabeled data. We show that our hybrid training
  procedure enables models to achieve competitive results in the MNIST quadrant prediction
  task in the fully-supervised setting, and sets new benchmarks in the semi-supervised
  regime for MNIST, SVHN, and CelebA.
