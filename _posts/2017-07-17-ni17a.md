abstract: Clustering data with both continuous and discrete attributes is a challenging
  task. Existing methods lack a principled probabilistic formulation. In this paper,
  we propose a clustering method based on a tree-structured graphical model to describe
  the generation process of mixed-type data. Our tree-structured model factorized
  into a product of pairwise interactions, and thus localizes the interaction between
  feature variables of different types. To provide a robust clustering method based
  on the tree-model, we adopt a topographical view and compute peaks of the density
  function and their attractive basins for clustering. Furthermore, we leverage the
  theory from topology data analysis to adaptively merge trivial peaks into large
  ones in order to achieve meaningful clusterings. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
  methods on mixed-type data.
