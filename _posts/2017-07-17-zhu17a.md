abstract: 'We propose a generic stochastic expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm
  for the estimation of high-dimensional latent variable models. At the core of our
  algorithm is a novel semi-stochastic variance-reduced gradient designed for the
  $Q$-function in the EM algorithm. Under a mild condition on the initialization,
  our algorithm is guaranteed to attain a linear convergence rate to the unknown parameter
  of the latent variable model, and achieve an optimal statistical rate up to a logarithmic
  factor for parameter estimation. Compared with existing high-dimensional EM algorithms,
  our algorithm enjoys a better computational complexity and is therefore more efficient.
  We apply our generic algorithm to two illustrative latent variable models: Gaussian
  mixture model and mixture of linear regression, and demonstrate the advantages of
  our algorithm by both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. We believe
  that the proposed semi-stochastic gradient is of independent interest for general
  nonconvex optimization problems with bivariate structures.'
