abstract: 'The problem of automatically generating a computer program from some specification
  has been studied since the early days of AI. Recently, two competing approaches
  for ‘automatic program learning’ have received significant attention: (1) ‘neural
  program synthesis’, where a neural network is conditioned on input/output (I/O)
  examples and learns to generate a program, and (2) ‘neural program induction’, where
  a neural network generates new outputs directly using a latent program representation.
  Here, for the first time, we directly compare both approaches on a large-scale,
  real-world learning task and we additionally contrast to rule-based program synthesis,
  which uses hand-crafted semantics to guide the program generation. Our neural models
  use a modified attention RNN to allow encoding of variable-sized sets of I/O pairs,
  which achieve 92% accuracy on a real-world test set, compared to the 34% accuracy
  of the previous best neural synthesis approach. The synthesis model also outperforms
  a comparable induction model on this task, but we more importantly demonstrate that
  the strength of each approach is highly dependent on the evaluation metric and end-user
  application. Finally, we show that we can train our neural models to remain very
  robust to the type of noise expected in real-world data (e.g., typos), while a highly-engineered
  rule-based system fails entirely.'
