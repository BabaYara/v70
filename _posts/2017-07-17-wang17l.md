abstract: We consider empirical risk minimization of linear predictors with convex
  loss functions. Such problems can be reformulated as convex-concave saddle point
  problems and solved by primal-dual first-order algorithms. However, primal-dual
  algorithms often require explicit strongly convex regularization in order to obtain
  fast linear convergence, and the required dual proximal mapping may not admit closed-form
  or efficient solution. In this paper, we develop both batch and randomized primal-dual
  algorithms that can exploit strong convexity from data adaptively and are capable
  of achieving linear convergence even without regularization. We also present dual-free
  variants of adaptive primal-dual algorithms that do not need the dual proximal mapping,
  which are especially suitable for logistic regression.
