abstract: Finding statistically significant high-order interactions in predictive
  modeling is important but challenging task because the possible number of high-order
  interactions is extremely large (e.g., $&gt; 10^{17}$). In this paper we study feature
  selection and statistical inference for sparse high-order interaction models. Our
  main contribution is to extend recently developed selective inference framework
  for linear models to high-order interaction models by developing a novel algorithm
  for efficiently characterizing the selection event for the selective inference of
  high-order interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm
  by applying it to an HIV drug response prediction problem.
