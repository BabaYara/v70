abstract: We develop the method of stochastic modified equations (SME), in which stochastic
  gradient algorithms are approximated in the weak sense by continuous-time stochastic
  differential equations. We exploit the continuous formulation together with optimal
  control theory to derive novel adaptive hyper-parameter adjustment policies. Our
  algorithms have competitive performance with the added benefit of being robust to
  varying models and datasets. This provides a general methodology for the analysis
  and design of stochastic gradient algorithms.
