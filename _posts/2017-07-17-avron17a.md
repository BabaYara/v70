abstract: Random Fourier features is one of the most popular techniques for scaling
  up kernel methods, such as kernel ridge regression. However, despite impressive
  empirical results, the statistical properties of random Fourier features are still
  not well understood. In this paper we take steps toward filling this gap. Specifically,
  we approach random Fourier features from a spectral matrix approximation point of
  view, give tight bounds on the number of Fourier features required to achieve a
  spectral approximation, and show how spectral matrix approximation bounds imply
  statistical guarantees for kernel ridge regression.
