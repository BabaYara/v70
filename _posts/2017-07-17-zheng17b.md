abstract: With the fast development of deep learning, it has become common to learn
  big neural networks using massive training data. Asynchronous Stochastic Gradient
  Descent (ASGD) is widely adopted to fulfill this task for its efficiency, which
  is, however, known to suffer from the problem of delayed gradients. That is, when
  a local worker adds its gradient to the global model, the global model may have
  been updated by other workers and this gradient becomes “delayed”. We propose a
  novel technology to compensate this delay, so as to make the optimization behavior
  of ASGD closer to that of sequential SGD. This is achieved by leveraging Taylor
  expansion of the gradient function and efficient approximators to the Hessian matrix
  of the loss function. We call the new algorithm Delay Compensated ASGD (DC-ASGD).
  We evaluated the proposed algorithm on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, and the experimental
  results demonstrate that DC-ASGD outperforms both synchronous SGD and asynchronous
  SGD, and nearly approaches the performance of sequential SGD.
