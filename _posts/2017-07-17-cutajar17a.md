abstract: The composition of multiple Gaussian Processes as a Deep Gaussian Process
  DGP enables a deep probabilistic nonparametric approach to flexibly tackle complex
  machine learning problems with sound quantification of uncertainty. Existing inference
  approaches for DGP models have limited scalability and are notoriously cumbersome
  to construct. In this work we introduce a novel formulation of DGPs based on random
  feature expansions that we train using stochastic variational inference. This yields
  a practical learning framework which significantly advances the state-of-the-art
  in inference for DGPs, and enables accurate quantification of uncertainty. We extensively
  showcase the scalability and performance of our proposal on several datasets with
  up to 8 million observations, and various DGP architectures with up to 30 hidden
  layers.
