abstract: We present an approach to adaptively utilize deep neural networks in order
  to reduce the evaluation time on new examples without loss of accuracy. Rather than
  attempting to redesign or approximate existing networks, we propose two schemes
  that adaptively utilize networks. We first pose an adaptive network evaluation scheme,
  where we learn a system to adaptively choose the components of a deep network to
  be evaluated for each example. By allowing examples correctly classified using early
  layers of the system to exit, we avoid the computational time associated with full
  evaluation of the network. We extend this to learn a network selection system that
  adaptively selects the network to be evaluated for each example. We show that computational
  time can be dramatically reduced by exploiting the fact that many examples can be
  correctly classified using relatively efficient networks and that complex, computationally
  costly networks are only necessary for a small fraction of examples. We pose a global
  objective for learning an adaptive early exit or network selection policy and solve
  it by reducing the policy learning problem to a layer-by-layer weighted binary classification
  problem. Empirically, these approaches yield dramatic reductions in computational
  cost, with up to a 2.8x speedup on state-of-the-art networks from the ImageNet image
  recognition challenge with minimal ($&lt;1\%$) loss of top5 accuracy.
