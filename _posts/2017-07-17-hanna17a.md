abstract: 'We consider the task of evaluating a policy for a Markov decision process
  (MDP). The standard unbiased technique for evaluating a policy is to deploy the
  policy and observe its performance. We show that the data collected from deploying
  a different policy, commonly called the behavior policy, can be used to produce
  unbiased estimates with lower mean squared error than this standard technique. We
  derive an analytic expression for the optimal behavior policy â€” the behavior policy
  that minimizes the mean squared error of the resulting estimates. Because this expression
  depends on terms that are unknown in practice, we propose a novel policy evaluation
  sub-problem, behavior policy search: searching for a behavior policy that reduces
  mean squared error. We present a behavior policy search algorithm and empirically
  demonstrate its effectiveness in lowering the mean squared error of policy performance
  estimates.'
