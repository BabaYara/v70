abstract: We propose a generic framework based on a new stochastic variance-reduced
  gradient descent algorithm for accelerating nonconvex low-rank matrix recovery.
  Starting from an appropriate initial estimator, our proposed algorithm performs
  projected gradient descent based on a novel semi-stochastic gradient specifically
  designed for low-rank matrix recovery. Based upon the mild restricted strong convexity
  and smoothness conditions, we derive a projected notion of the restricted Lipschitz
  continuous gradient property, and prove that our algorithm enjoys linear convergence
  rate to the unknown low-rank matrix with an improved computational complexity. Moreover,
  our algorithm can be employed to both noiseless and noisy observations, where the
  (near) optimal sample complexity and statistical rate can be attained respectively.
  We further illustrate the superiority of our generic framework through several specific
  examples, both theoretically and experimentally.
