abstract: We present data streaming algorithms for the $k$-median problem in high-dimensional
  dynamic geometric data streams, i.e. streams allowing both insertions and deletions
  of points from a discrete Euclidean space ${1, 2, \ldots ∆}^d$. Our algorithms use
  $k ε^-2 \mathrmpoly(d \log ∆)$ space/time and maintain with high probability a small
  weighted set of points (a coreset) such that for every set of $k$ centers the cost
  of the coreset $(1+ε)$-approximates the cost of the streamed point set. We also
  provide algorithms that guarantee only positive weights in the coreset with additional
  logarithmic factors in the space and time complexities. We can use this positively-weighted
  coreset to compute a $(1+ε)$-approximation for the $k$-median problem by any efficient
  offline $k$-median algorithm. All previous algorithms for computing a $(1+ε)$-approximation
  for the $k$-median problem over dynamic data streams required space and time exponential
  in $d$. Our algorithms can be generalized to metric spaces of bounded doubling dimension.
