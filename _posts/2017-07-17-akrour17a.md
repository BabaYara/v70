abstract: 'Bayesian optimization is renowned for its sample efficiency but its application
  to higher dimensional tasks is impeded by its focus on global optimization. To scale
  to higher dimensional problems, we leverage the sample efficiency of Bayesian optimization
  in a local context. The optimization of the acquisition function is restricted to
  the vicinity of a Gaussian search distribution which is moved towards high value
  areas of the objective. The proposed information-theoretic update of the search
  distribution results in a Bayesian interpretation of local stochastic search: the
  search distribution encodes prior knowledge on the optimum’s location and is weighted
  at each iteration by the likelihood of this location’s optimality. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our algorithm on several benchmark objective functions as well
  as a continuous robotic task in which an informative prior is obtained by imitation
  learning.'
