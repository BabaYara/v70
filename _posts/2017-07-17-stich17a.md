abstract: We propose a new selection rule for the coordinate selection in coordinate
  descent methods for huge-scale optimization. The efficiency of this novel scheme
  is provably better than the efficiency of uniformly random selection, and can reach
  the efficiency of steepest coordinate descent (SCD), enabling an acceleration of
  a factor of up to $n$, the number of coordinates. In many practical applications,
  our scheme can be implemented at no extra cost and computational efficiency very
  close to the faster uniform selection. Numerical experiments with Lasso and Ridge
  regression show promising improvements, in line with our theoretical guarantees.
