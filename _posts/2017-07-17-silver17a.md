abstract: One of the key challenges of artificial intelligence is to learn models
  that are effective in the context of planning. In this document we introduce the
  predictron architecture. The predictron consists of a fully abstract model, represented
  by a Markov reward process, that can be rolled forward multiple “imagined” planning
  steps. Each forward pass of the predictron accumulates internal rewards and values
  over multiple planning depths. The predictron is trained end-to-end so as to make
  these accumulated values accurately approximate the true value function. We applied
  the predictron to procedurally generated random mazes and a simulator for the game
  of pool. The predictron yielded significantly more accurate predictions than conventional
  deep neural network architectures.
