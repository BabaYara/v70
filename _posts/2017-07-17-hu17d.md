abstract: 'We present a probabilistic framework for overlapping community discovery
  and link prediction for relational data, given as a graph. The proposed framework
  has: (1) a deep architecture which enables us to infer multiple layers of latent
  features/communities for each node, providing superior link prediction performance
  on more complex networks and better interpretability of the latent features; and
  (2) a regression model which allows directly conditioning the node latent features
  on the side information available in form of node attributes. Our framework handles
  both (1) and (2) via a clean, unified model, which enjoys full local conjugacy via
  data augmentation, and facilitates efficient inference via closed form Gibbs sampling.
  Moreover, inference cost scales in the number of edges which is attractive for massive
  but sparse networks. Our framework is also easily extendable to model weighted networks
  with count-valued edges. We compare with various state-of-the-art methods and report
  results, both quantitative and qualitative, on several benchmark data sets.'
