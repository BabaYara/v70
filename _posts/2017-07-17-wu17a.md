abstract: Multi-label classification deals with the problem where each instance is
  associated with multiple class labels. Because evaluation in multi-label classification
  is more complicated than single-label setting, a number of performance measures
  have been proposed. It is noticed that an algorithm usually performs differently
  on different measures. Therefore, it is important to understand which algorithms
  perform well on which measure(s) and why. In this paper, we propose a unified margin
  view to revisit eleven performance measures in multi-label classification. In particular,
  we define label-wise margin and instance-wise margin, and prove that through maximizing
  these margins, different corresponding performance measures are to be optimized.
  Based on the defined margins, a max-margin approach called LIMO is designed and
  empirical results validate our theoretical findings.
