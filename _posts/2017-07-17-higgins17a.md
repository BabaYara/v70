abstract: Domain adaptation is an important open problem in deep reinforcement learning
  (RL). In many scenarios of interest data is hard to obtain, so agents may learn
  a source policy in a setting where data is readily available, with the hope that
  it generalises well to the target domain. We propose a new multi-stage RL agent,
  DARLA (DisentAngled Representation Learning Agent), which learns to see before learning
  to act. DARLA’s vision is based on learning a disentangled representation of the
  observed environment. Once DARLA can see, it is able to acquire source policies
  that are robust to many domain shifts – even with no access to the target domain.
  DARLA significantly outperforms conventional baselines in zero-shot domain adaptation
  scenarios, an effect that holds across a variety of RL environments (Jaco arm, DeepMind
  Lab) and base RL algorithms (DQN, A3C and EC).
