abstract: Approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) offers the promise of more rapid
  sampling at the cost of more biased inference. Since standard MCMC diagnostics fail
  to detect these biases, researchers have developed computable Stein discrepancy
  measures that provably determine the convergence of a sample to its target distribution.
  This approach was recently combined with the theory of reproducing kernels to define
  a closed-form kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD) computable by summing kernel evaluations
  across pairs of sample points. We develop a theory of weak convergence for KSDs
  based on Steinâ€™s method, demonstrate that commonly used KSDs fail to detect non-convergence
  even for Gaussian targets, and show that kernels with slowly decaying tails provably
  determine convergence for a large class of target distributions. The resulting convergence-determining
  KSDs are suitable for comparing biased, exact, and deterministic sample sequences
  and simpler to compute and parallelize than alternative Stein discrepancies. We
  use our tools to compare biased samplers, select sampler hyperparameters, and improve
  upon existing KSD approaches to one-sample hypothesis testing and sample quality
  improvement.
