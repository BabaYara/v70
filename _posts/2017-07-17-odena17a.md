abstract: In this paper we introduce new methods for the improved training of generative
  adversarial networks (GANs) for image synthesis. We construct a variant of GANs
  employing label conditioning that results in $128\times 128$ resolution image samples
  exhibiting global coherence. We expand on previous work for image quality assessment
  to provide two new analyses for assessing the discriminability and diversity of
  samples from class-conditional image synthesis models. These analyses demonstrate
  that high resolution samples provide class information not present in low resolution
  samples. Across 1000 ImageNet classes, $128\times 128$ samples are more than twice
  as discriminable as artificially resized $32\times 32$ samples. In addition, 84.7\%
  of the classes have samples exhibiting diversity comparable to real ImageNet data.
