abstract: Tensor decomposition is an important problem with many applications across
  several disciplines, and a popular approach for this problem is the tensor power
  method. However, previous works with theoretical guarantee based on this approach
  can only find the top eigenvectors one after one, unlike the case for matrices.
  In this paper, we show how to find the eigenvectors simultaneously with the help
  of a new initialization procedure. This allows us to achieve a better running time
  in the batch setting, as well as a lower sample complexity in the streaming setting.
