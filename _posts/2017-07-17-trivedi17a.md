abstract: The availability of large scale event data with time stamps has given rise
  to dynamically evolving knowledge graphs that contain temporal information for each
  edge. Reasoning over time in such dynamic knowledge graphs is not yet well understood.
  To this end, we present Know-Evolve, a novel deep evolutionary knowledge network
  that learns non-linearly evolving entity representations over time. The occurrence
  of a fact (edge) is modeled as a multivariate point process whose intensity function
  is modulated by the score for that fact computed based on the learned entity embeddings.
  We demonstrate significantly improved performance over various relational learning
  approaches on two large scale real-world datasets. Further, our method effectively
  predicts occurrence or recurrence time of a fact which is novel compared to prior
  reasoning approaches in multi-relational setting.
