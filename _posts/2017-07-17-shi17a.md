abstract: 'While simulated game environments have greatly accelerated research in
  reinforcement learning, existing environments lack the open-domain realism of tasks
  in computer vision or natural language processing, which operate on artifacts created
  by humans in natural, organic settings. To foster reinforcement learning research
  in such settings, we introduce the World of Bits (WoB), a platform in which agents
  complete tasks on the Internet by performing low-level keyboard and mouse actions.
  The two main challenges are: (i) to curate a large, diverse set of interesting web-based
  tasks, and (ii) to ensure that these tasks have a well-defined reward structure
  and are reproducible despite the transience of the web. To do this, we develop a
  methodology in which crowdworkers create tasks defined by natural language questions
  and provide demonstrations of how to answer the question on real websites using
  keyboard and mouse; HTTP traffic is cached to create a reproducible offline approximation
  of the web site. Finally, we show that agents trained via behavioral cloning and
  reinforcement learning can successfully complete a range of our web-based tasks.'
