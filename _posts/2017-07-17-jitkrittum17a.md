abstract: A new computationally efficient dependence measure, and an adaptive statistical
  test of independence, are proposed. The dependence measure is the difference between
  analytic embeddings of the joint distribution and the product of the marginals,
  evaluated at a finite set of locations (features). These features are chosen so
  as to maximize a lower bound on the test power, resulting in a test that is data-efficient,
  and that runs in linear time (with respect to the sample size n). The optimized
  features can be interpreted as evidence to reject the null hypothesis, indicating
  regions in the joint domain where the joint distribution and the product of the
  marginals differ most. Consistency of the independence test is established, for
  an appropriate choice of features. In real-world benchmarks, independence tests
  using the optimized features perform comparably to the state-of-the-art quadratic-time
  HSIC test, and outperform competing O(n) and O(n log n) tests.
