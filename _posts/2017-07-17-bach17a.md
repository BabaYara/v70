abstract: Curating labeled training data has become the primary bottleneck in machine
  learning. Recent frameworks address this bottleneck with generative models to synthesize
  labels at scale from weak supervision sources. The generative model’s dependency
  structure directly affects the quality of the estimated labels, but selecting a
  structure automatically without any labeled data is a distinct challenge. We propose
  a structure estimation method that maximizes the l1-regularized marginal pseudolikelihood
  of the observed data. Our analysis shows that the amount of unlabeled data required
  to identify the true structure scales sublinearly in the number of possible dependencies
  for a broad class of models. Simulations show that our method is 100x faster than
  a maximum likelihood approach and selects 1/4 as many extraneous dependencies. We
  also show that our method provides an average of 1.5 F1 points of improvement over
  existing, user-developed information extraction applications on real-world data
  such as PubMed journal abstracts.
