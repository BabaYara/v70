abstract: We investigate a novel cluster-of-bandit algorithm CAB for collaborative
  recommendation tasks that implements the underlying feedback sharing mechanism by
  estimating user neighborhoods in a context-dependent manner. CAB makes sharp departures
  from the state of the art by incorporating collaborative effects into inference,
  as well as learning processes in a manner that seamlessly interleaves explore-exploit
  tradeoffs and collaborative steps. We prove regret bounds for CAB under various
  data-dependent assumptions which exhibit a crisp dependence on the expected number
  of clusters over the users, a natural measure of the statistical difficulty of the
  learning task. Experiments on production and real-world datasets show that CAB offers
  significantly increased prediction performance against a representative pool of
  state-of-the-art methods.
