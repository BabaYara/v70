abstract: Deep networks have been successfully applied to learn transferable features
  for adapting models from a source domain to a different target domain. In this paper,
  we present joint adaptation networks (JAN), which learn a transfer network by aligning
  the joint distributions of multiple domain-specific layers across domains based
  on a joint maximum mean discrepancy (JMMD) criterion. Adversarial training strategy
  is adopted to maximize JMMD such that the distributions of the source and target
  domains are made more distinguishable. Learning can be performed by stochastic gradient
  descent with the gradients computed by back-propagation in linear-time. Experiments
  testify that our model yields state of the art results on standard datasets.
