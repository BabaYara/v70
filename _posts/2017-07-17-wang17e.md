abstract: Entropy Search (ES) and Predictive Entropy Search (PES) are popular and
  empirically successful Bayesian Optimization techniques. Both rely on a compelling
  information-theoretic motivation, and maximize the information gained about the
  $\arg\max$ of the unknown function; yet, both are plagued by the expensive computation
  for estimating entropies. We propose a new criterion, Max-value Entropy Search (MES),
  that instead uses the information about the maximum function value. We show relations
  of MES to other Bayesian optimization methods, and establish a regret bound. We
  observe that MES maintains or improves the good empirical performance of ES/PES,
  while tremendously lightening the computational burden. In particular, MES is much
  more robust to the number of samples used for computing the entropy, and hence more
  efficient for higher dimensional problems.
