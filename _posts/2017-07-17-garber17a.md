abstract: We study the fundamental problem of Principal Component Analysis in a statistical
  distributed setting in which each machine out of m stores a sample of n points sampled
  i.i.d. from a single unknown distribution. We study algorithms for estimating the
  leading principal component of the population covariance matrix that are both communication-efficient
  and achieve estimation error of the order of the centralized ERM solution that uses
  all mn samples. On the negative side, we show that in contrast to results obtained
  for distributed estimation under convexity assumptions, for the PCA objective, simply
  averaging the local ERM solutions cannot guarantee error that is consistent with
  the centralized ERM. We show that this unfortunate phenomena can be remedied by
  performing a simple correction step which correlates between the individual solutions,
  and provides an estimator that is consistent with the centralized ERM for sufficiently-large
  n. We also introduce an iterative distributed algorithm that is applicable in any
  regime of n, which is based on distributed matrix-vector products. The algorithm
  gives significant acceleration in terms of communication rounds over previous distributed
  algorithms, in a wide regime of parameters.
