abstract: We consider the problem of statistical inference for ranking data, specifically
  rank aggregation, under the assumption that samples are incomplete in the sense
  of not comprising all choice alternatives. In contrast to most existing methods,
  we explicitly model the process of turning a full ranking into an incomplete one,
  which we call the coarsening process. To this end, we propose the concept of rank-dependent
  coarsening, which assumes that incomplete rankings are produced by projecting a
  full ranking to a random subset of ranks. For a concrete instantiation of our model,
  in which full rankings are drawn from a Plackett-Luce distribution and observations
  take the form of pairwise preferences, we study the performance of various rank
  aggregation methods. In addition to predictive accuracy in the finite sample setting,
  we address the theoretical question of consistency, by which we mean the ability
  to recover a target ranking when the sample size goes to infinity, despite a potential
  bias in the observations caused by the (unknown) coarsening.
