abstract: Temporal point processes have been widely applied to model event sequence
  data generated by online users. In this paper, we consider the problem of how to
  design the optimal control policy for point processes, such that the stochastic
  system driven by the point process is steered to a target state. In particular,
  we exploit the key insight to view the stochastic optimal control problem from the
  perspective of optimal measure and variational inference. We further propose a convex
  optimization framework and an efficient algorithm to update the policy adaptively
  to the current system state. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that
  our algorithm can steer the user activities much more accurately and efficiently
  than other stochastic control methods.
