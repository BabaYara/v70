abstract: 'We describe a generalization of the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden
  Markov Model (HDP-HMM) which is able to encode prior information that state transitions
  are more likely between “nearby” states. This is accomplished by defining a similarity
  function on the state space and scaling transition probabilities by pairwise similarities,
  thereby inducing correlations among the transition distributions. We present an
  augmented data representation of the model as a Markov Jump Process in which: (1)
  some jump attempts fail, and (2) the probability of success is proportional to the
  similarity between the source and destination states. This augmentation restores
  conditional conjugacy and admits a simple Gibbs sampler. We evaluate the model and
  inference method on a speaker diarization task and a “harmonic parsing” task using
  four-part chorale data, as well as on several synthetic datasets, achieving favorable
  comparisons to existing models.'
