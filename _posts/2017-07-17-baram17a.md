abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been successfully applied to
  the problem of <em>policy imitation</em> in a model-free setup. However, the computation
  graph of GANs, that include a stochastic policy as the generative model, is no longer
  differentiable end-to-end, which requires the use of high-variance gradient estimation.
  In this paper, we introduce the Model-based Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning
  (MGAIL) algorithm. We show how to use a forward model to make the computation fully
  differentiable, which enables training policies using the exact gradient of the
  discriminator. The resulting algorithm trains competent policies using relatively
  fewer expert samples and interactions with the environment. We test it on both discrete
  and continuous action domains and report results that surpass the state-of-the-art.
