abstract: 'We introduce a model that learns active learning algorithms via metalearning.
  For a distribution of related tasks, our model jointly learns: a data representation,
  an item selection heuristic, and a prediction function. Our model uses the item
  selection heuristic to construct a labeled support set for training the prediction
  function. Using the Omniglot and MovieLens datasets, we test our model in synthetic
  and practical settings.'
