abstract: Statistical learning theory is at an inflection point enabled by recent
  advances in understanding and optimizing a wide range of metrics. Of particular
  interest are non-decomposable metrics such as the F-measure and the Jaccard measure
  which cannot be represented as a simple average over examples. Non-decomposability
  is the primary source of difficulty in theoretical analysis, and interestingly has
  led to two distinct settings and notions of consistency. In this manuscript we analyze
  both settings, from statistical and algorithmic points of view, to explore the connections
  and to highlight differences between them for a wide range of metrics. The analysis
  complements previous results on this topic, clarifies common confusions around both
  settings, and provides guidance to the theory and practice of binary classification
  with complex metrics.
