abstract: Using unitary (instead of general) matrices in artificial neural networks
  (ANNs) is a promising way to solve the gradient explosion/vanishing problem, as
  well as to enable ANNs to learn long-term correlations in the data. This approach
  appears particularly promising for Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). In this work,
  we present a new architecture for implementing an Efficient Unitary Neural Network
  (EUNNs); its main advantages can be summarized as follows. Firstly, the representation
  capacity of the unitary space in an EUNN is fully tunable, ranging from a subspace
  of SU(N) to the entire unitary space. Secondly, the computational complexity for
  training an EUNN is merely $\mathcal{O}(1)$ per parameter. Finally, we test the
  performance of EUNNs on the standard copying task, the pixel-permuted MNIST digit
  recognition benchmark as well as the Speech Prediction Test (TIMIT). We find that
  our architecture significantly outperforms both other state-of-the-art unitary RNNs
  and the LSTM architecture, in terms of the final performance and/or the wall-clock
  training speed. EUNNs are thus promising alternatives to RNNs and LSTMs for a wide
  variety of applications.
