abstract: While humans easily recognize relations between data from different domains
  without any supervision, learning to automatically discover them is in general very
  challenging and needs many ground-truth pairs that illustrate the relations. To
  avoid costly pairing, we address the task of discovering cross-domain relations
  given unpaired data. We propose a method based on a generative adversarial network
  that learns to discover relations between different domains (DiscoGAN). Using the
  discovered relations, our proposed network successfully transfers style from one
  domain to another while preserving key attributes such as orientation and face identity.
