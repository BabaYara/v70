abstract: 'We provide several new depth-based separation results for feed-forward
  neural networks, proving that various types of simple and natural functions can
  be better approximated using deeper networks than shallower ones, even if the shallower
  networks are much larger. This includes indicators of balls and ellipses; non-linear
  functions which are radial with respect to the $L_1$ norm; and smooth non-linear
  functions. We also show that these gaps can be observed experimentally: Increasing
  the depth indeed allows better learning than increasing width, when training neural
  networks to learn an indicator of a unit ball.'
