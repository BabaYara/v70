abstract: We consider computationally tractable methods for the experimental design
  problem, where k out of n design points of dimension p are selected so that certain
  optimality criteria are approximately satisfied. Our algorithm finds a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate
  optimal design when k is a linear function of p; in contrast, existing results require
  k to be super-linear in p. Our algorithm also handles all popular optimality criteria,
  while existing ones only handle one or two such criteria. Numerical results on synthetic
  and real-world design problems verify the practical effectiveness of the proposed
  algorithm.
