abstract: Standard clustering methods such as K-means, Gaussian mixture models, and
  hierarchical clustering are beset by local minima, which are sometimes drastically
  suboptimal. Moreover the number of clusters K must be known in advance. The recently
  introduced the sum-of-norms (SON) or Clusterpath convex relaxation of k-means and
  hierarchical clustering shrinks cluster centroids toward one another and ensure
  a unique global minimizer. We give a scalable stochastic incremental algorithm based
  on proximal iterations to solve the SON problem with convergence guarantees. We
  also show that the algorithm recovers clusters under quite general conditions which
  have a similar form to the unifying proximity condition introduced in the approximation
  algorithms community (that covers paradigm cases such as Gaussian mixtures and planted
  partition models). We give experimental results to confirm that our algorithm scales
  much better than previous methods while producing clusters of comparable quality.
