abstract: Motivated by electricity consumption reconstitution, we propose a new matrix
  recovery method using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). The task tackled here
  is to reconstitute electricity consumption time series at a fine temporal scale
  from measures that are temporal aggregates of individual consumption. Contrary to
  existing NMF algorithms, the proposed method uses temporal aggregates as input data,
  instead of matrix entries. Furthermore, the proposed method is extended to take
  into account individual autocorrelation to provide better estimation, using a recent
  convex relaxation of quadratically constrained quadratic programs. Extensive experiments
  on synthetic and real-world electricity consumption datasets illustrate the effectiveness
  of the proposed method.
