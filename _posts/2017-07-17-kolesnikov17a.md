abstract: 'We study probabilistic models of natural images and extend the autoregressive
  family of PixelCNN models by incorporating auxiliary variables. Subsequently, we
  describe two new generative image models that exploit different image transformations
  as auxiliary variables: a quantized grayscale view of the image or a multi-resolution
  image pyramid. The proposed models tackle two known shortcomings of existing PixelCNN
  models: 1) their tendency to focus on low-level image details, while largely ignoring
  high-level image information, such as object shapes, and 2) their computationally
  costly procedure for image sampling. We experimentally demonstrate benefits of our
  models, in particular showing that they produce much more realistically looking
  image samples than previous state-of-the-art probabilistic models.'
