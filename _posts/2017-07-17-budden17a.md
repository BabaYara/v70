abstract: Deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) of 3-dimensional kernels allow
  joint modeling of spatiotemporal features. These networks have improved performance
  of video and volumetric image analysis, but have been limited in size due to the
  low memory ceiling of GPU hardware. Existing CPU implementations overcome this constraint
  but are impractically slow. Here we extend and optimize the faster Winograd-class
  of convolutional algorithms to the $N$-dimensional case and specifically for CPU
  hardware. First, we remove the need to manually hand-craft algorithms by exploiting
  the relaxed constraints and cheap sparse access of CPU memory. Second, we maximize
  CPU utilization and multicore scalability by transforming data matrices to be cache-aware,
  integer multiples of AVX vector widths. Treating 2-dimensional ConvNets as a special
  (and the least beneficial) case of our approach, we demonstrate a 5 to 25-fold improvement
  in throughput compared to previous state-of-the-art.
