abstract: Many real-world applications require robust algorithms to learn point process
  models based on a type of incomplete data — the so-called short doubly-censored
  (SDC) event sequences. In this paper, we study this critical problem of quantitative
  asynchronous event sequence analysis under the framework of Hawkes processes by
  leveraging the general idea of data synthesis. In particular, given SDC event sequences
  observed in a variety of time intervals, we propose a sampling-stitching data synthesis
  method — sampling predecessor and successor for each SDC event sequence from potential
  candidates and stitching them together to synthesize long training sequences. The
  rationality and the feasibility of our method are discussed in terms of arguments
  based on likelihood. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate
  that the proposed data synthesis method improves learning results indeed for both
  time-invariant and time-varying Hawkes processes.
