abstract: Learning transformation invariant representations of visual data is an important
  problem in computer vision. Deep convolutional networks have demonstrated remarkable
  results for image and video classification tasks. However, they have achieved only
  limited success in the classification of images that undergo geometric transformations.
  In this work we present a novel Transformation Invariant Graph-based Network (TIGraNet),
  which learns graph-based features that are inherently invariant to isometric transformations
  such as rotation and translation of input images. In particular, images are represented
  as signals on graphs, which permits to replace classical convolution and pooling
  layers in deep networks with graph spectral convolution and dynamic graph pooling
  layers that together contribute to invariance to isometric transformation. Our experiments
  show high performance on rotated and translated images from the test set compared
  to classical architectures that are very sensitive to transformations in the data.
  The inherent invariance properties of our framework provide key advantages, such
  as increased resiliency to data variability and sustained performance with limited
  training sets.
