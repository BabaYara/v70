abstract: We introduce a new local-to-global structure learning algorithm, called
  graph growing structure learning (GGSL), to learn Bayesian network (BN) structures.
  GGSL starts at a (random) node and then gradually expands the learned structure
  through a series of local learning steps. At each local learning step, the proposed
  algorithm only needs to revisit a subset of the learned nodes, consisting of the
  local neighborhood of a target, and therefore improves on both memory and time efficiency
  compared to traditional global structure learning approaches. GGSL also improves
  on the existing local-to-global learning approaches by removing the need for conflict-resolving
  AND-rules, and achieves better learning accuracy. We provide theoretical analysis
  for the local learning step, and show that GGSL outperforms existing algorithms
  on benchmark datasets. Overall, GGSL demonstrates a novel direction to scale up
  BN structure learning while limiting accuracy loss.
