abstract: We provide a deterministic data summarization algorithm that approximates
  the mean $\barp=\frac1n\sum_p∈P p$ of a set $P$ of $n$ vectors in $\mathbbR^d$,
  by a weighted mean $\tildep$ of a \emphsubset of $O(1/ε)$ vectors, i.e., independent
  of both $n$ and $d$. We prove that the squared Euclidean distance between $\barp$
  and $\tildep$ is at most $ε$ multiplied by the variance of $P$. We use this algorithm
  to maintain an approximated sum of vectors from an unbounded stream, using memory
  that is independent of $d$, and logarithmic in the $n$ vectors seen so far. Our
  main application is to extract and represent in a compact way friend groups and
  activity summaries of users from underlying data exchanges. For example, in the
  case of mobile networks, we can use GPS traces to identify meetings; in the case
  of social networks, we can use information exchange to identify friend groups. Our
  algorithm provably identifies the \emphHeavy Hitter entries in a proximity (adjacency)
  matrix. The Heavy Hitters can be used to extract and represent in a compact way
  friend groups and activity summaries of users from underlying data exchanges. We
  evaluate the algorithm on several large data sets.
