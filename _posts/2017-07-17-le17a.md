abstract: We study the problem of imitation learning from demonstrations of multiple
  coordinating agents. One key challenge in this setting is that learning a good model
  of coordination can be difficult, since coordination is often implicit in the demonstrations
  and must be inferred as a latent variable. We propose a joint approach that simultaneously
  learns a latent coordination model along with the individual policies. In particular,
  our method integrates unsupervised structure learning with conventional imitation
  learning. We illustrate the power of our approach on a difficult problem of learning
  multiple policies for fine-grained behavior modeling in team sports, where different
  players occupy different roles in the coordinated team strategy. We show that having
  a coordination model to infer the roles of players yields substantially improved
  imitation loss compared to conventional baselines.
