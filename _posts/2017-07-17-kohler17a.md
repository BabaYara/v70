abstract: We consider the minimization of non-convex functions that typically arise
  in machine learning. Specifically, we focus our attention on a variant of trust
  region methods known as cubic regularization. This approach is particularly attractive
  because it escapes strict saddle points and it provides stronger convergence guarantees
  than first- and second-order as well as classical trust region methods. However,
  it suffers from a high computational complexity that makes it impractical for large-scale
  learning. Here, we propose a novel method that uses sub-sampling to lower this computational
  cost. By the use of concentration inequalities we provide a sampling scheme that
  gives sufficiently accurate gradient and Hessian approximations to retain the strong
  global and local convergence guarantees of cubically regularized methods. To the
  best of our knowledge this is the first work that gives global convergence guarantees
  for a sub-sampled variant of cubic regularization on non-convex functions. Furthermore,
  we provide experimental results supporting our theory.
