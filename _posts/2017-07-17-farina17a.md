abstract: 'No-regret learning has emerged as a powerful tool for solving extensive-form
  games. This was facilitated by the counterfactual-regret minimization (CFR) framework,
  which relies on the instantiation of regret minimizers for simplexes at each information
  set of the game. We use an instantiation of the CFR framework to develop algorithms
  for solving behaviorally-constrained (and, as a special case, perturbed in the Selten
  sense) extensive-form games, which allows us to compute approximate Nash equilibrium
  refinements. Nash equilibrium refinements are motivated by a major deficiency in
  Nash equilibrium: it provides virtually no guarantees on how it will play in parts
  of the game tree that are reached with zero probability. Refinements can mend this
  issue, but have not been adopted in practice, mostly due to a lack of scalable algorithms.
  We show that, compared to standard algorithms, our method finds solutions that have
  substantially better refinement properties, while enjoying a convergence rate that
  is comparable to that of state-of-the-art algorithms for Nash equilibrium computation
  both in theory and practice.'
