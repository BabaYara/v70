abstract: Developing a dialogue agent that is capable of making autonomous decisions
  and communicating by natural language is one of the long-term goals of machine learning
  research. The traditional approaches either rely on hand-crafting a small state-action
  set for applying reinforcement learning that is not scalable or constructing deterministic
  models for learning dialogue sentences that fail to capture the conversational stochasticity.
  In this paper, however, we propose a Latent Intention Dialogue Model that employs
  a discrete latent variable to learn underlying dialogue intentions in the framework
  of neural variational inference. Additionally, in a goal-oriented dialogue scenario,
  the latent intentions can be interpreted as actions guiding the generation of machine
  responses, which can be further refined autonomously by reinforcement learning.
  The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of discrete latent variable models
  on learning goal-oriented dialogues, and the results outperform the published benchmarks
  on both corpus-based evaluation and human evaluation.
