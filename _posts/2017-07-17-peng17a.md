abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are powerful non-parametric function estimators.
  However, their applications are largely limited by the expensive computational cost
  of the inference procedures. Existing stochastic or distributed synchronous variational
  inferences, although have alleviated this issue by scaling up GPs to millions of
  samples, are still far from satisfactory for real-world large applications, where
  the data sizes are often orders of magnitudes larger, say, billions. To solve this
  problem, we propose ADVGP, the first Asynchronous Distributed Variational Gaussian
  Process inference for regression, on the recent large-scale machine learning platform,
  PARAMETER SERVER. ADVGP uses a novel, flexible variational framework based on a
  weight space augmentation, and implements the highly efficient, asynchronous proximal
  gradient optimization. While maintaining comparable or better predictive performance,
  ADVGP greatly improves upon the efficiency of the existing variational methods.
  With ADVGP, we effortlessly scale up GP regression to a real-world application with
  billions of samples and demonstrate an excellent, superior prediction accuracy to
  the popular linear models.
