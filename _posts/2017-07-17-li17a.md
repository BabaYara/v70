abstract: 'To obtain uncertainty estimates with real-world Bayesian deep learning
  models, practical inference approximations are needed. Dropout variational inference
  (VI) for example has been used for machine vision and medical applications, but
  VI can severely underestimates model uncertainty. Alpha-divergences are alternative
  divergences to VI’s KL objective, which are able to avoid VI’s uncertainty underestimation.
  But these are hard to use in practice: existing techniques can only use Gaussian
  approximating distributions, and require existing models to be changed radically,
  thus are of limited use for practitioners. We propose a re-parametrisation of the
  alpha-divergence objectives, deriving a simple inference technique which, together
  with dropout, can be easily implemented with existing models by simply changing
  the loss of the model. We demonstrate improved uncertainty estimates and accuracy
  compared to VI in dropout networks. We study our model’s epistemic uncertainty far
  away from the data using adversarial images, showing that these can be distinguished
  from non-adversarial images by examining our model’s uncertainty.'
