abstract: 'For many applications of reinforcement learning it can be more convenient
  to specify both a reward function and constraints, rather than trying to design
  behavior through the reward function. For example, systems that physically interact
  with or around humans should satisfy safety constraints. Recent advances in policy
  search algorithms (Mnih et al., 2016, Schulman et al., 2015, Lillicrap et al., 2016,
  Levine et al., 2016) have enabled new capabilities in high-dimensional control,
  but do not consider the constrained setting. We propose Constrained Policy Optimization
  (CPO), the first general-purpose policy search algorithm for constrained reinforcement
  learning with guarantees for near-constraint satisfaction at each iteration. Our
  method allows us to train neural network policies for high-dimensional control while
  making guarantees about policy behavior all throughout training. Our guarantees
  are based on a new theoretical result, which is of independent interest: we prove
  a bound relating the expected returns of two policies to an average divergence between
  them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on simulated robot locomotion
  tasks where the agent must satisfy constraints motivated by safety.'
