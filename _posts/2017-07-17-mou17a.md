abstract: Building neural networks to query a knowledge base (a table) with natural
  language is an emerging research topic in deep learning. An executor for table querying
  typically requires multiple steps of execution because queries may have complicated
  structures. In previous studies, researchers have developed either fully distributed
  executors or symbolic executors for table querying. A distributed executor can be
  trained in an end-to-end fashion, but is weak in terms of execution efficiency and
  explicit interpretability. A symbolic executor is efficient in execution, but is
  very difficult to train especially at initial stages. In this paper, we propose
  to couple distributed and symbolic execution for natural language queries, where
  the symbolic executor is pretrained with the distributed executorâ€™s intermediate
  execution results in a step-by-step fashion. Experiments show that our approach
  significantly outperforms both distributed and symbolic executors, exhibiting high
  accuracy, high learning efficiency, high execution efficiency, and high interpretability.
