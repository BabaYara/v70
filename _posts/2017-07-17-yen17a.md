abstract: The latent feature model (LFM), proposed in (Griffiths & Ghahramani, 2005),
  but possibly with earlier origins, is a generalization of a mixture model, where
  each instance is generated not from a single latent class but from a combination
  of \emphlatent features. Thus, each instance has an associated latent binary feature
  incidence vector indicating the presence or absence of a feature. Due to its combinatorial
  nature, inference of LFMs is considerably intractable, and accordingly, most of
  the attention has focused on nonparametric LFMs, with priors such as the Indian
  Buffet Process (IBP) on infinite binary matrices. Recent efforts to tackle this
  complexity either still have computational complexity that is exponential, or sample
  complexity that is high-order polynomial w.r.t. the number of latent features. In
  this paper, we address this outstanding problem of tractable estimation of LFMs
  via a novel atomic-norm regularization, which gives an algorithm with polynomial
  run-time and sample complexity without impractical assumptions on the data distribution.
