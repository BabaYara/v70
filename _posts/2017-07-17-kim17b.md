abstract: We propose a novel deep neural network that is both lightweight and effectively
  structured for model parallelization. Our network, which we name as SplitNet, automatically
  learns to split the network weights into either a set or a hierarchy of multiple
  groups that use disjoint sets of features, by learning both the class-to-group and
  feature-to-group assignment matrices along with the network weights. This produces
  a tree-structured network that involves no connection between branched subtrees
  of semantically disparate class groups. SplitNet thus greatly reduces the number
  of parameters and requires significantly less computations, and is also embarrassingly
  model parallelizable at test time, since the network evaluation for each subnetwork
  is completely independent except for the shared lower layer weights that can be
  duplicated over multiple processors. We validate our method with two deep network
  models (ResNet and AlexNet) on two different datasets (CIFAR-100 and ILSVRC 2012)
  for image classification, on which our method obtains networks with significantly
  reduced number of parameters while achieving comparable or superior classification
  accuracies over original full deep networks, and accelerated test speed with multiple
  GPUs.
