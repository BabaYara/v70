abstract: We consider the problem of provably optimal exploration in reinforcement
  learning for finite horizon MDPs. We show that an optimistic modification to value
  iteration achieves a regret bound of $\tilde O( \sqrtHSAT + H^2S^2A+H\sqrtT)$ where
  $H$ is the time horizon, $S$ the number of states, $A$ the number of actions and
  $T$ the number of time-steps. This result improves over the best previous known
  bound $\tilde O(HS \sqrtAT)$ achieved by the UCRL2 algorithm. The key significance
  of our new results is that when $T≥H^3S^3A$ and $SA≥H$, it leads to a regret of
  $\tildeO(\sqrtHSAT)$ that matches the established lower bound of $Ω(\sqrtHSAT)$
  up to a logarithmic factor. Our analysis contain two key insights. We use careful
  application of concentration inequalities to the optimal value function as a whole,
  rather than to the transitions probabilities (to improve scaling in $S$), and we
  define Bernstein-based “exploration bonuses” that use the empirical variance of
  the estimated values at the next states (to improve scaling in $H$).
