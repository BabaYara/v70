abstract: 'We investigate the problem of learning discrete graphical models in a differentially
  private way. Approaches to this problem range from privileged algorithms that conduct
  learning completely behind the privacy barrier to schemes that release private summary
  statistics paired with algorithms to learn parameters from those statistics. We
  show that the approach of releasing noisy sufficient statistics using the Laplace
  mechanism achieves a good trade-off between privacy, utility, and practicality.
  A naive learning algorithm that uses the noisy sufficient statistics “as is” outperforms
  general-purpose differentially private learning algorithms. However, it has three
  limitations: it ignores knowledge about the data generating process, rests on uncertain
  theoretical foundations, and exhibits certain pathologies. We develop a more principled
  approach that applies the formalism of collective graphical models to perform inference
  over the true sufficient statistics within an expectation-maximization framework.
  We show that this learns better models than competing approaches on both synthetic
  data and on real human mobility data used as a case study.'
