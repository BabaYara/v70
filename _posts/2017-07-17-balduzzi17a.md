abstract: 'As artificial agents proliferate, it is becoming increasingly important
  to ensure that their interactions with one another are well-behaved. In this paper,
  we formalize a common-sense notion of when algorithms are well-behaved: an algorithm
  is safe if it does no harm. Motivated by recent progress in deep learning, we focus
  on the specific case where agents update their actions according to gradient descent.
  The paper shows that that gradient descent converges to a Nash equilibrium in safe
  games. The main contribution is to define strongly-typed agents and show they are
  guaranteed to interact safely, thereby providing sufficient conditions to guarantee
  safe interactions. A series of examples show that strong-typing generalizes certain
  key features of convexity, is closely related to blind source separation, and introduces
  a new perspective on classical multilinear games based on tensor decomposition.'
