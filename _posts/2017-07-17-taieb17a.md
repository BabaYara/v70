abstract: Many applications require forecasts for a hierarchy comprising a set of
  time series along with aggregates of subsets of these series. Hierarchical forecasting
  require not only good prediction accuracy at each level of the hierarchy, but also
  the coherency between different levels â€” the property that forecasts add up appropriately
  across the hierarchy. A fundamental limitation of prior research is the focus on
  forecasting the mean of each time series. We consider the situation where probabilistic
  forecasts are needed for each series in the hierarchy, and propose an algorithm
  to compute predictive distributions rather than mean forecasts only. Our algorithm
  has the advantage of synthesizing information from different levels in the hierarchy
  through a sparse forecast combination and a probabilistic hierarchical aggregation.
  We evaluate the accuracy of our forecasting algorithm on both simulated data and
  large-scale electricity smart meter data. The results show consistent performance
  gains compared to state-of-the art methods.
