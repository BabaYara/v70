abstract: 'This paper develops differentially private mechanisms for $\chi^2$ test
  of independence. While existing works put their effort into properly controlling
  the type-I error, in addition to that, we investigate the type-II error of differentially
  private mechanisms. Based on the analysis, we present unit circle mechanism: a novel
  differentially private mechanism based on the geometrical property of the test statistics.
  Compared to existing output perturbation mechanisms, our mechanism improves the
  dominated term of the type-II error from $O(1)$ to $O(\exp(-\sqrt{N}))$ where $N$
  is the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce novel procedures for multiple $\chi^2$
  tests by incorporating the unit circle mechanism into the sparse vector technique
  and the exponential mechanism. These procedures can control the family-wise error
  rate (FWER) properly, which has never been attained by existing mechanisms.'
