abstract: Combining abstract, symbolic reasoning with continuous neural reasoning
  is a grand challenge of representation learning. As a step in this direction, we
  propose a new architecture, called neural equivalence network, for the problem of
  learning continuous semantic representations of algebraic and logical expressions.
  These networks are trained to represent semantic equivalence, even of expressions
  that are syntactically very different. The challenge is that semantic representations
  must be computed in a syntax-directed manner, because semantics is compositional,
  but at the same time, small changes in syntax can lead to very large changes in
  semantics, which can be difficult for continuous neural architectures. We perform
  an exhaustive evaluation on the task of checking equivalence on a highly diverse
  class of symbolic algebraic and boolean expression types, showing that our model
  significantly outperforms existing architectures.
