abstract: Deep networks are highly nonlinear and difficult to optimize. During training,
  the parameter iterate may move from one local basin to another, or the data distribution
  may even change. Inspired by the close connection between stochastic optimization
  and online learning, we propose a variant of the \emphfollow the regularized leader
  (FTRL) algorithm called \emphfollow the moving leader (FTML). Unlike the FTRL family
  of algorithms, the recent samples are weighted more heavily in each iteration and
  so FTML can adapt more quickly to changes. We show that FTML enjoys the nice properties
  of RMSprop and Adam, while avoiding their pitfalls. Experimental results on a number
  of deep learning models and tasks demonstrate that FTML converges quickly, and outperforms
  other state-of-the-art optimizers.
