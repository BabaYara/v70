abstract: This paper describes an expectation propagation (EP) method for multi-class
  classification with Gaussian processes that scales well to very large datasets.
  In such a method the estimate of the log-marginal-likelihood involves a sum across
  the data instances. This enables efficient training using stochastic gradients and
  mini-batches. When this type of training is used, the computational cost does not
  depend on the number of data instances N. Furthermore, extra assumptions in the
  approximate inference process make the memory cost independent of N. The consequence
  is that the proposed EP method can be used on datasets with millions of instances.
  We compare empirically this method with alternative approaches that approximate
  the required computations using variational inference. The results show that it
  performs similar or even better than these techniques, which sometimes give significantly
  worse predictive distributions in terms of the test log-likelihood. Besides this,
  the training process of the proposed approach also seems to converge in a smaller
  number of iterations.
