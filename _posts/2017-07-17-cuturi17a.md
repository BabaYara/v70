abstract: We propose in this paper a differentiable learning loss between time series,
  building upon the celebrated dynamic time warping (DTW) discrepancy. Unlike the
  Euclidean distance, DTW can compare time series of variable size and is robust to
  shifts or dilatations across the time dimension. To compute DTW, one typically solves
  a minimal-cost alignment problem between two time series using dynamic programming.
  Our work takes advantage of a smoothed formulation of DTW, called soft-DTW, that
  computes the soft-minimum of all alignment costs. We show in this paper that soft-DTW
  is a \emphdifferentiable loss function, and that both its value and gradient can
  be computed with quadratic time/space complexity (DTW has quadratic time but linear
  space complexity). We show that this regularization is particularly well suited
  to average and cluster time series under the DTW geometry, a task for which our
  proposal significantly outperforms existing baselines (Petitjean et al., 2011).
  Next, we propose to tune the parameters of a machine that outputs time series by
  minimizing its fit with ground-truth labels in a soft-DTW sense. Source code is
