abstract: 'We develop and analyze a variant of Nesterov’s accelerated gradient descent
  (AGD) for minimization of smooth non-convex functions. We prove that one of two
  cases occurs: either our AGD variant converges quickly, as if the function was convex,
  or we produce a certificate that the function is “guilty” of being non-convex. This
  non-convexity certificate allows us to exploit negative curvature and obtain deterministic,
  dimension-free acceleration of convergence for non-convex functions. For a function
  $f$ with Lipschitz continuous gradient and Hessian, we compute a point $x$ with
  $\|\nabla f(x)\| \le \epsilon$ in $O(\epsilon^{-7/4} \log(1/ \epsilon) )$ gradient
  and function evaluations. Assuming additionally that the third derivative is Lipschitz,
  we require only $O(\epsilon^{-5/3} \log(1/ \epsilon) )$ evaluations.'
