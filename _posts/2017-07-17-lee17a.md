abstract: We present a model for random simple graphs with power law (i.e., heavy-tailed)
  degree distributions. To attain this behavior, the edge probabilities in the graph
  are constructed from Bertoin–Fujita–Roynette–Yor (BFRY) random variables, which
  have been recently utilized in Bayesian statistics for the construction of power
  law models in several applications. Our construction readily extends to capture
  the structure of latent factors, similarly to stochastic block-models, while maintaining
  its power law degree distribution. The BFRY random variables are well approximated
  by gamma random variables in a variational Bayesian inference routine, which we
  apply to several network datasets for which power law degree distributions are a
  natural assumption. By learning the parameters of the BFRY distribution via probabilistic
  inference, we are able to automatically select the appropriate power law behavior
  from the data. In order to further scale our inference procedure, we adopt stochastic
  gradient ascent routines where the gradients are computed on minibatches (i.e.,
  subsets) of the edges in the graph.
