abstract: 'In multi-task learning, a learner is given a collection of prediction tasks
  and needs to solve all of them. In contrast to previous work, which required that
  annotated training data must be available for all tasks, we consider a new setting,
  in which for some tasks, potentially most of them, only unlabeled training data
  is provided. Consequently, to solve all tasks, information must be transferred between
  tasks with labels and tasks without labels. Focusing on an instance-based transfer
  method we analyze two variants of this setting: when the set of labeled tasks is
  fixed, and when it can be actively selected by the learner. We state and prove a
  generalization bound that covers both scenarios and derive from it an algorithm
  for making the choice of labeled tasks (in the active case) and for transferring
  information between the tasks in a principled way. We also illustrate the effectiveness
  of the algorithm on synthetic and real data.'
