abstract: The acclaimed successes of neural networks often overshadow their tremendous
  complexity. We focus on numerical precision â€“ a key parameter defining the complexity
  of neural networks. First, we present theoretical bounds on the accuracy in presence
  of limited precision. Interestingly, these bounds can be computed via the back-propagation
  algorithm. Hence, by combining our theoretical analysis and the back-propagation
  algorithm, we are able to readily determine the minimum precision needed to preserve
  accuracy without having to resort to time-consuming fixed-point simulations. We
  provide numerical evidence showing how our approach allows us to maintain high accuracy
  but with lower complexity than state-of-the-art binary networks.
