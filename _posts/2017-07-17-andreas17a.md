abstract: We describe a framework for multitask deep reinforcement learning guided
  by policy sketches. Sketches annotate tasks with sequences of named subtasks, providing
  information about high-level structural relationships among tasks but not how to
  implement them—specifically not providing the detailed guidance used by much previous
  work on learning policy abstractions for RL (e.g. intermediate rewards, subtask
  completion signals, or intrinsic motivations). To learn from sketches, we present
  a model that associates every subtask with a modular subpolicy, and jointly maximizes
  reward over full task-specific policies by tying parameters across shared subpolicies.
  Optimization is accomplished via a decoupled actor–critic training objective that
  facilitates learning common behaviors from multiple dissimilar reward functions.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in three environments featuring both
  discrete and continuous control, and with sparse rewards that can be obtained only
  after completing a number of high-level subgoals. Experiments show that using our
  approach to learn policies guided by sketches gives better performance than existing
  techniques for learning task-specific or shared policies, while naturally inducing
  a library of interpretable primitive behaviors that can be recombined to rapidly
  adapt to new tasks.
