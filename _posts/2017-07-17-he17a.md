abstract: In the context of supervised tensor learning, preserving the structural
  information and exploiting the discriminative nonlinear relationships of tensor
  data are crucial for improving the performance of learning tasks. Based on tensor
  factorization theory and kernel methods, we propose a novel Kernelized Support Tensor
  Machine (KSTM) which integrates kernelized tensor factorization with maximum-margin
  criterion. Specifically, the kernelized factorization technique is introduced to
  approximate the tensor data in kernel space such that the complex nonlinear relationships
  within tensor data can be explored. Further, dual structural preserving kernels
  are devised to learn the nonlinear boundary between tensor data. As a result of
  joint optimization, the kernels obtained in KSTM exhibit better generalization power
  to discriminative analysis. The experimental results on real-world neuroimaging
  datasets show the superiority of KSTM over the state-of-the-art techniques.
