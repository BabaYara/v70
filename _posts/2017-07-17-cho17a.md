abstract: Convolution is a critical component in modern deep neural networks, thus
  several algorithms for convolution have been developed. Direct convolution is simple
  but suffers from poor performance. As an alternative, multiple indirect methods
  have been proposed including im2col-based convolution, FFT-based convolution, or
  Winograd-based algorithm. However, all these indirect methods have high memory overhead,
  which creates performance degradation and offers a poor trade-off between performance
  and memory consumption. In this work, we propose a memory-efficient convolution
  or MEC with compact lowering, which reduces memory overhead substantially and accelerates
  convolution process. MEC lowers the input matrix in a simple yet efficient/compact
  way (i.e., much less memory overhead), and then executes multiple small matrix multiplications
  in parallel to get convolution completed. Additionally, the reduced memory footprint
  improves memory sub-system efficiency, improving performance. Our experimental results
  show that MEC reduces memory consumption significantly with good speedup on both
  mobile and server platforms, compared with other indirect convolution algorithms.
