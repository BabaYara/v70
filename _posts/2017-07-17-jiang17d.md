abstract: 'Active search is an active learning setting with the goal of identifying
  as many members of a given class as possible under a labeling budget. In this work,
  we first establish a theoretical hardness of active search, proving that no polynomial-time
  policy can achieve a constant factor approximation ratio with respect to the expected
  utility of the optimal policy. We also propose a novel, computationally efficient
  active search policy achieving exceptional performance on several real-world tasks.
  Our policy is nonmyopic, always considering the entire remaining search budget.
  It also automatically and dynamically balances exploration and exploitation consistent
  with the remaining budget, without relying on a parameter to control this tradeoff.
  We conduct experiments on diverse datasets from several domains: drug discovery,
  materials science, and a citation network. Our efficient nonmyopic policy recovers
  significantly more valuable points with the same budget than several alternatives
  from the literature, including myopic approximations to the optimal policy.'
