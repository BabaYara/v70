abstract: Structured Prediction Energy Networks (SPENs) are a simple, yet expressive
  family of structured prediction models (Belanger and McCallum, 2016). An energy
  function over candidate structured outputs is given by a deep network, and predictions
  are formed by gradient-based optimization. This paper presents end-to-end learning
  for SPENs, where the energy function is discriminatively trained by back-propagating
  through gradient-based prediction. In our experience, the approach is substantially
  more accurate than the structured SVM method of Belanger and McCallum (2016), as
  it allows us to use more sophisticated non-convex energies. We provide a collection
  of techniques for improving the speed, accuracy, and memory requirements of end-to-end
  SPENs, and demonstrate the power of our method on 7-Scenes image denoising and CoNLL-2005
  semantic role labeling tasks. In both, inexact minimization of non-convex SPEN energies
  is superior to baseline methods that use simplistic energy functions that can be
  minimized exactly.
