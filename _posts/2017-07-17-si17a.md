abstract: In this paper, we study the gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT) when
  the output space is high dimensional and sparse. For example, in multilabel classification,
  the output space is a $L$-dimensional 0/1 vector, where $L$ is number of labels
  that can grow to millions and beyond in many modern applications. We show that vanilla
  GBDT can easily run out of memory or encounter near-forever running time in this
  regime, and propose a new GBDT variant, GBDT-SPARSE, to resolve this problem by
  employing $L_0$ regularization. We then discuss in detail how to utilize this sparsity
  to conduct GBDT training, including splitting the nodes, computing the sparse residual,
  and predicting in sublinear time. Finally, we apply our algorithm to extreme multilabel
  classification problems, and show that the proposed GBDT-SPARSE achieves an order
  of magnitude improvements in model size and prediction time over existing methods,
  while yielding similar performance.
