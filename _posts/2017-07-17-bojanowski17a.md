abstract: Convolutional neural networks provide visual features that perform remarkably
  well in many computer vision applications. However, training these networks requires
  significant amounts of supervision; this paper introduces a generic framework to
  train such networks, end-to-end, with no supervision. We propose to fix a set of
  target representations, called Noise As Targets (NAT), and to constrain the deep
  features to align to them. This domain agnostic approach avoids the standard unsupervised
  learning issues of trivial solutions and collapsing of the features. Thanks to a
  stochastic batch reassignment strategy and a separable square loss function, it
  scales to millions of images. The proposed approach produces representations that
  perform on par with the state-of-the-arts among unsupervised methods on ImageNet
  and Pascal VOC.
