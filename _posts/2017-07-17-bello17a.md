abstract: We present an approach to automate the process of discovering optimization
  methods, with a focus on deep learning architectures. We train a Recurrent Neural
  Network controller to generate a string in a specific domain language that describes
  a mathematical update equation based on a list of primitive functions, such as the
  gradient, running average of the gradient, etc. The controller is trained with Reinforcement
  Learning to maximize the performance of a model after a few epochs. On CIFAR-10,
  our method discovers several update rules that are better than many commonly used
  optimizers, such as Adam, RMSProp, or SGD with and without Momentum on a ConvNet
  model. These optimizers can also be transferred to perform well on different neural
  network architectures, including Googleâ€™s neural machine translation system.
