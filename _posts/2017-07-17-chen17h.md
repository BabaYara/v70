abstract: Multiview representation learning is popular for latent factor analysis.
  Many existing approaches formulate the multiview representation learning as convex
  optimization problems, where global optima can be obtained by certain algorithms
  in polynomial time. However, many evidences have corroborated that heuristic nonconvex
  approaches also have good empirical computational performance and convergence to
  the global optima, although there is a lack of theoretical justification. Such a
  gap between theory and practice motivates us to study a nonconvex formulation for
  multiview representation learning, which can be efficiently solved by a simple stochastic
  gradient descent method. By analyzing the dynamics of the algorithm based on diffusion
  processes, we establish a global rate of convergence to the global optima. Numerical
  experiments are provided to support our theory.
