abstract: We develop a framework for combining differentiable programming languages
  with neural networks. Using this framework we create end-to-end trainable systems
  that learn to write interpretable algorithms with perceptual components. We explore
  the benefits of inductive biases for strong generalization and modularity that come
  from the program-like structure of our models. In particular, modularity allows
  us to learn a library of (neural) functions which grows and improves as more tasks
  are solved. Empirically, we show that this leads to lifelong learning systems that
  transfer knowledge to new tasks more effectively than baselines.
