abstract: This paper studies systematic exploration for reinforcement learning (RL)
  with rich observations and function approximation. We introduce contextual decision
  processes (CDPs), that unify most prior RL settings. Our first contribution is a
  complexity measure, the Bellman rank, that we show enables tractable learning of
  near-optimal behavior in CDPs and is naturally small for many well-studied RL models.
  Our second contribution is a new RL algorithm that does systematic exploration to
  learn near-optimal behavior in CDPs with low Bellman rank. The algorithm requires
  a number of samples that is polynomial in all relevant parameters but independent
  of the number of unique contexts. Our approach uses Bellman error minimization with
  optimistic exploration and provides new insights into efficient exploration for
  RL with function approximation.
