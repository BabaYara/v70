abstract: We consider the online one-class collaborative filtering (CF) problem that
  consist of recommending items to users over time in an online fashion based on positive
  ratings only. This problem arises when users respond only occasionally to a recommendation
  with a positive rating, and never with a negative one. We study the impact of the
  probability of a user responding to a recommendation, $p_f$, on the sample complexity,
  and ask whether receiving positive and negative ratings, instead of positive ratings
  only, improves the sample complexity. Both questions arise in the design of recommender
  systems. We introduce a simple probabilistic user model, and analyze the performance
  of an online user-based CF algorithm. We prove that after an initial cold start
  phase, where recommendations are invested in exploring the user’s preferences, this
  algorithm makes—up to a fraction of the recommendations required for updating the
  user’s preferences—perfect recommendations. The number of ratings required for the
  cold start phase is nearly proportional to $1/p_f$, and that for updating the user’s
  preferences is essentially independent of $p_f$. As a consequence we find that,
  receiving positive and negative ratings instead of only positive ones improves the
  number of ratings required for initial exploration by a factor of $1/p_f$, which
  can be significant.
