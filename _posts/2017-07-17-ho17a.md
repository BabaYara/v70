abstract: We propose a novel approach to the problem of multilevel clustering, which
  aims to simultaneously partition data in each group and discover grouping patterns
  among groups in a potentially large hierarchically structured corpus of data. Our
  method involves a joint optimization formulation over several spaces of discrete
  probability measures, which are endowed with Wasserstein distance metrics. We propose
  a number of variants of this problem, which admit fast optimization algorithms,
  by exploiting the connection to the problem of finding Wasserstein barycenters.
  Consistency properties are established for the estimates of both local and global
  clusters. Finally, experiment results with both synthetic and real data are presented
  to demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of the proposed approach.
