abstract: Recurrent neural network models with an attention mechanism have proven
  to be extremely effective on a wide variety of sequence-to-sequence problems. However,
  the fact that soft attention mechanisms perform a pass over the entire input sequence
  when producing each element in the output sequence precludes their use in online
  settings and results in a quadratic time complexity. Based on the insight that the
  alignment between input and output sequence elements is monotonic in many problems
  of interest, we propose an end-to-end differentiable method for learning monotonic
  alignments which, at test time, enables computing attention online and in linear
  time. We validate our approach on sentence summarization, machine translation, and
  online speech recognition problems and achieve results competitive with existing
  sequence-to-sequence models.
