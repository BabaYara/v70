abstract: We address the statistical and optimization impacts of using classical sketch
  versus Hessian sketch to solve approximately the Matrix Ridge Regression (MRR) problem.
  Prior research has considered the effects of classical sketch on least squares regression
  (LSR), a strictly simpler problem. We establish that classical sketch has a similar
  effect upon the optimization properties of MRR as it does on those of LSR—namely,
  it recovers nearly optimal solutions. In contrast, Hessian sketch does not have
  this guarantee; instead, the approximation error is governed by a subtle interplay
  between the “mass” in the responses and the optimal objective value. For both types
  of approximations, the regularization in the sketched MRR problem gives it significantly
  different statistical properties from the sketched LSR problem. In particular, there
  is a bias-variance trade-off in sketched MRR that is not present in sketched LSR.
  We provide upper and lower bounds on the biases and variances of sketched MRR; these
  establish that the variance is significantly increased when classical sketches are
  used, while the bias is significantly increased when using Hessian sketches. Empirically,
  sketched MRR solutions can have risks that are higher by an order-of-magnitude than
  those of the optimal MRR solutions. We establish theoretically and empirically that
  model averaging greatly decreases this gap. Thus, in the distributed setting, sketching
  combined with model averaging is a powerful technique that quickly obtains near-optimal
  solutions to the MRR problem while greatly mitigating the statistical risks incurred
  by sketching.
