abstract: Kernel representations provide a nonlinear representation, through similarities
  to prototypes, but require only simple linear learning algorithms given those prototypes.
  In a continual learning setting, with a constant stream of observations, it is critical
  to have an efficient mechanism for sub-selecting prototypes amongst observations.
  In this work, we develop an approximately submodular criterion for this setting,
  and an efficient online greedy submodular maximization algorithm for optimizing
  the criterion. We extend streaming submodular maximization algorithms to continual
  learning, by removing the need for multiple passes—which is infeasible—and instead
  introducing the idea of coverage time. We propose a general block-diagonal approximation
  for the greedy update with our criterion, that enables updates linear in the number
  of prototypes. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of this approximation,
  in terms of approximation quality, significant runtime improvements, and effective
  prediction performance.
