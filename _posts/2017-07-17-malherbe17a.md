abstract: The goal of the paper is to design sequential strategies which lead to efficient
  optimization of an unknown function under the only assumption that it has a finite
  Lipschitz constant. We first identify sufficient conditions for the consistency
  of generic sequential algorithms and formulate the expected minimax rate for their
  performance. We introduce and analyze a first algorithm called LIPO which assumes
  the Lipschitz constant to be known. Consistency, minimax rates for LIPO are proved,
  as well as fast rates under an additional Hölder like condition. An adaptive version
  of LIPO is also introduced for the more realistic setup where Lipschitz constant
  is unknown and has to be estimated along with the optimization. Similar theoretical
  guarantees are shown to hold for the adaptive LIPO algorithm and a numerical assessment
  is provided at the end of the paper to illustrate the potential of this strategy
  with respect to state-of-the-art methods over typical benchmark problems for global
  optimization.
