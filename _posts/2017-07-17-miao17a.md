abstract: Topic models have been widely explored as probabilistic generative models
  of documents. Traditional inference methods have sought closed-form derivations
  for updating the models, however as the expressiveness of these models grows, so
  does the difficulty of performing fast and accurate inference over their parameters.
  This paper presents alternative neural approaches to topic modelling by providing
  parameterisable distributions over topics which permit training by backpropagation
  in the framework of neural variational inference. In addition, with the help of
  a stick-breaking construction, we propose a recurrent network that is able to discover
  a notionally unbounded number of topics, analogous to Bayesian non-parametric topic
  models. Experimental results on the MXM Song Lyrics, 20NewsGroups and Reuters News
  datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of these neural topic models.
