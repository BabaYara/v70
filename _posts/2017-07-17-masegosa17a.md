abstract: Making inferences from data streams is a pervasive problem in many modern
  data analysis applications. But it requires to address the problem of continuous
  model updating, and adapt to changes or drifts in the underlying data generating
  distribution. In this paper, we approach these problems from a Bayesian perspective
  covering general conjugate exponential models. Our proposal makes use of non-conjugate
  hierarchical priors to explicitly model temporal changes of the model parameters.
  We also derive a novel variational inference scheme which overcomes the use of non-conjugate
  priors while maintaining the computational efficiency of variational methods over
  conjugate models. The approach is validated on three real data sets over three latent
  variable models.
