abstract: 'To be tractable and robust to data noise, existing metric learning algorithms
  commonly rely on PCA as a pre-processing step. How can we know, however, that PCA,
  or any other specific dimensionality reduction technique, is the method of choice
  for the problem at hand? The answer is simple: We cannot! To address this issue,
  in this paper, we develop a Riemannian framework to jointly learn a mapping performing
  dimensionality reduction and a metric in the induced space. Our experiments evidence
  that, while we directly work on high-dimensional features, our approach yields competitive
  runtimes with and higher accuracy than state-of-the-art metric learning algorithms.'
