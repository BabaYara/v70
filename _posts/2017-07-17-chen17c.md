abstract: 'We consider online content recommendation with implicit feedback through
  pairwise comparisons, formalized as the so-called dueling bandit problem. We study
  the dueling bandit problem in the Condorcet winner setting, and consider two notions
  of regret: the more well-studied strong regret, which is 0 only when both arms pulled
  are the Condorcet winner; and the less well-studied weak regret, which is 0 if either
  arm pulled is the Condorcet winner. We propose a new algorithm for this problem,
  Winner Stays (WS), with variations for each kind of regret: WS for weak regret (WS-W)
  has expected cumulative weak regret that is $O(N^2)$, and $O(N\log(N))$ if arms
  have a total order; WS for strong regret (WS-S) has expected cumulative strong regret
  of $O(N^2 + N \log(T))$, and $O(N\log(N)+N\log(T))$ if arms have a total order.
  WS-W is the first dueling bandit algorithm with weak regret that is constant in
  time. WS is simple to compute, even for problems with many arms, and we demonstrate
  through numerical experiments on simulated and real data that WS has significantly
  smaller regret than existing algorithms in both the weak- and strong-regret settings.'
