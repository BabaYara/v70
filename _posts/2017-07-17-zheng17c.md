abstract: Non-interactive Local Differential Privacy (LDP) requires data analysts
  to collect data from users through noisy channel at once. In this paper, we extend
  the frontiers of Non-interactive LDP learning and estimation from several aspects.
  For learning with smooth generalized linear losses, we propose an approximate stochastic
  gradient oracle estimated from non-interactive LDP channel using Chebyshev expansion,
  which is combined with inexact gradient methods to obtain an efficient algorithm
  with quasi-polynomial sample complexity bound. For the high-dimensional world, we
  discover that under $\ell_2$-norm assumption on data points, high-dimensional sparse
  linear regression and mean estimation can be achieved with logarithmic dependence
  on dimension, using random projection and approximate recovery. We also extend our
  methods to Kernel Ridge Regression. Our work is the first one that makes learning
  and estimation possible for a broad range of learning tasks under non-interactive
  LDP model.
