abstract: Generative models in vision have seen rapid progress due to algorithmic
  improvements and the availability of high-quality image datasets. In this paper,
  we offer contributions in both these areas to enable similar progress in audio modeling.
  First, we detail a powerful new WaveNet-style autoencoder model that conditions
  an autoregressive decoder on temporal codes learned from the raw audio waveform.
  Second, we introduce NSynth, a large-scale and high-quality dataset of musical notes
  that is an order of magnitude larger than comparable public datasets. Using NSynth,
  we demonstrate improved qualitative and quantitative performance of the WaveNet
  autoencoder over a well-tuned spectral autoencoder baseline. Finally, we show that
  the model learns a manifold of embeddings that allows for morphing between instruments,
  meaningfully interpolating in timbre to create new types of sounds that are realistic
  and expressive.
