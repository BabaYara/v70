abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning with deep neural networks has achieved
  great success in challenging continuous control problems such as 3D locomotion and
  robotic manipulation. However, in real-world control problems, the actions one can
  take are bounded by physical constraints, which introduces a bias when the standard
  Gaussian distribution is used as the stochastic policy. In this work, we propose
  to use the Beta distribution as an alternative and analyze the bias and variance
  of the policy gradients of both policies. We show that the Beta policy is bias-free
  and provides significantly faster convergence and higher scores over the Gaussian
  policy when both are used with trust region policy optimization (TRPO) and actor
  critic with experience replay (ACER), the state-of-the-art on- and off-policy stochastic
  methods respectively, on OpenAI Gym’s and MuJoCo’s continuous control environments.
