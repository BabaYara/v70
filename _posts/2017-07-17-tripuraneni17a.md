abstract: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) exploits Hamiltonian dynamics to construct
  efficient proposals for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In this paper, we present
  a generalization of HMC which exploits non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics. We refer
  to this algorithm as magnetic HMC, since in 3 dimensions a subset of the dynamics
  map onto the mechanics of a charged particle coupled to a magnetic field. We establish
  a theoretical basis for the use of non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics in MCMC, and
  construct a symplectic, leapfrog-like integrator allowing for the implementation
  of magnetic HMC. Finally, we exhibit several examples where these non-canonical
  dynamics can lead to improved mixing of magnetic HMC relative to ordinary HMC.
