abstract: In this paper, we explore theoretical properties of training a two-layered
  ReLU network $g(\mathbfx; \mathbfw) = \sum_j=1^K σ(\mathbfw_j^⊤\mathbfx)$ with centered
  $d$-dimensional spherical Gaussian input $\mathbfx$ ($σ$=ReLU). We train our network
  with gradient descent on $\mathbfw$ to mimic the output of a teacher network with
  the same architecture and fixed parameters $\mathbfw^*$. We show that its population
  gradient has an analytical formula, leading to interesting theoretical analysis
  of critical points and convergence behaviors. First, we prove that critical points
  outside the hyperplane spanned by the teacher parameters (“out-of-plane“) are not
  isolated and form manifolds, and characterize in-plane critical-point-free regions
  for two-ReLU case. On the other hand, convergence to $\mathbfw^*$ for one ReLU node
  is guaranteed with at least $(1-ε)/2$ probability, if weights are initialized randomly
  with standard deviation upper-bounded by $O(ε/\sqrtd)$, in accordance with empirical
  practice. For network with many ReLU nodes, we prove that an infinitesimal perturbation
  of weight initialization results in convergence towards $\mathbfw^*$ (or its permutation),
  a phenomenon known as spontaneous symmetric-breaking (SSB) in physics. We assume
  no independence of ReLU activations. Simulation verifies our findings.
