abstract: In this paper, we explore theoretical properties of training a two-layered
  ReLU network $g(\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{w}) = \sum_{j=1}^K \sigma(\mathbf{w}_j^\top\mathbf{x})$
  with centered $d$-dimensional spherical Gaussian input $\mathbf{x}$ ($\sigma$=ReLU).
  We train our network with gradient descent on $\mathbf{w}$ to mimic the output of
  a teacher network with the same architecture and fixed parameters $\mathbf{w}^*$.
  We show that its population gradient has an analytical formula, leading to interesting
  theoretical analysis of critical points and convergence behaviors. First, we prove
  that critical points outside the hyperplane spanned by the teacher parameters (“out-of-plane“)
  are not isolated and form manifolds, and characterize in-plane critical-point-free
  regions for two-ReLU case. On the other hand, convergence to $\mathbf{w}^*$ for
  one ReLU node is guaranteed with at least $(1-\epsilon)/2$ probability, if weights
  are initialized randomly with standard deviation upper-bounded by $O(\epsilon/\sqrt{d})$,
  in accordance with empirical practice. For network with many ReLU nodes, we prove
  that an infinitesimal perturbation of weight initialization results in convergence
  towards $\mathbf{w}^*$ (or its permutation), a phenomenon known as spontaneous symmetric-breaking
  (SSB) in physics. We assume no independence of ReLU activations. Simulation verifies
  our findings.
