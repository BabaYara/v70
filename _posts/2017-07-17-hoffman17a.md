abstract: 'Deep latent Gaussian models are powerful and popular probabilistic models
  of high-dimensional data. These models are almost always fit using variational expectation-maximization,
  an approximation to true maximum-marginal-likelihood estimation. In this paper,
  we propose a different approach: rather than use a variational approximation (which
  produces biased gradient signals), we use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC, which
  allows us to trade bias for computation). We find that our MCMC-based approach has
  several advantages: it yields higher held-out likelihoods, produces sharper images,
  and does not suffer from the variational overpruning effect. MCMCâ€™s additional computational
  overhead proves to be significant, but not prohibitive.'
