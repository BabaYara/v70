abstract: 'There exist many problem domains where the interpretability of neural network
  models is essential for deployment. Here we introduce a recurrent architecture composed
  of input-switched affine transformations – in other words an RNN without any explicit
  nonlinearities, but with input-dependent recurrent weights. This simple form allows
  the RNN to be analyzed via straightforward linear methods: we can exactly characterize
  the linear contribution of each input to the model predictions; we can use a change-of-basis
  to disentangle input, output, and computational hidden unit subspaces; we can fully
  reverse-engineer the architecture’s solution to a simple task. Despite this ease
  of interpretation, the input switched affine network achieves reasonable performance
  on a text modeling tasks, and allows greater computational efficiency than networks
  with standard nonlinearities.'
