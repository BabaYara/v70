abstract: In this paper we consider nonconvex optimization and learning over a network
  of distributed nodes. We develop a Proximal Primal-Dual Algorithm (Prox-PDA), which
  enables the network nodes to distributedly and collectively compute the set of first-order
  stationary solutions in a global sublinear manner [with a rate of $O(1/r)$, where
  $r$ is the iteration counter]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm
  that enables distributed nonconvex optimization with global rate guarantees. Our
  numerical experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
